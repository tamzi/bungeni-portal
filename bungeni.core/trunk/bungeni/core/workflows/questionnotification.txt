Notifications
=============

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows import questionnotification as notification
  >>> from zope.component.interfaces import ObjectEvent

Setup mock delivery component.

  >>> import zope.sendmail.interfaces
  
  >>> class MockMailDelivery(object):
  ...     interface.implements(zope.sendmail.interfaces.IMailDelivery)
  ...
  ...     def send(self, *args):
  ...         print "From: %s\nTo: %s\n\n%s" % args

  >>> component.provideUtility(MockMailDelivery())

Set up a user.

  >>> from bungeni import models as model
  >>> from datetime import datetime

  >>> from bungeni.models.domain import User
  >>> user = User()
  >>> user.first_name = u'John'
  >>> user.last_name = u'Doe'
  >>> user.email = 'john.doe@localhost'

  
  >>> from ore.alchemist import Session
  >>> session = Session()
  >>> session.save(user)
  >>> session.flush()

we need a parliament, government ministry and ministers 
to send the question notification to.

  >>> from bungeni import models as model
  >>> parliament = model.Parliament( short_name=u"p_1", start_date=datetime.now(), election_date=datetime.now())
  >>> session.save(parliament)
  >>> session.flush()
  
  >>> gov = model.Government(short_name=u"gov_1", start_date=datetime.now())
  >>> gov.parliament_id = parliament.parliament_id
  >>> session.save(gov)
  >>> session.flush()  
  
  >>> country = model.Country()
  >>> country.country_id = 'KE'
  >>> country.country_name = u"Kenya"
  >>> session.save(country)
  >>> ministry = model.Ministry(short_name=u"A ministry", start_date=datetime.now())
  >>> ministry.government_id = gov.government_id
  >>> session.save(ministry)
  >>> session.flush()


  >>> mp_1 = model.ParliamentMember(u"minister 1", 
  ...        first_name=u"a", 
  ...        last_name=u'ab', 
  ...        birth_country="KE",
  ...        email=u"mp1@example.com", 
  ...        date_of_birth=datetime.now(),
  ...        gender='M')
  >>> mp_2 = model.ParliamentMember(u"minister 2", 
  ...        first_name=u"b", 
  ...        last_name=u"bc", 
  ...        birth_country="KE",  
  ...        date_of_birth=datetime.now(),
  ...        email=u"mp2@example.com",
  ...        gender='M')
  >>> mp_3 = model.ParliamentMember(u"No minister",
  ...        first_name=u"c", 
  ...        birth_country="KE",  
  ...        last_name=u"cd",
  ...        date_of_birth=datetime.now(),
  ...        email=u"mp3@example.com", 
  ...        gender='F')      

  >>> session.save( mp_1 )
  >>> session.save( mp_2 )
  >>> session.save( mp_3 )      
  >>> session.flush()

  >>> minister = model.Minister()
  >>> minister.group_id = ministry.group_id
  >>> minister.user_id = mp_1.user_id
  >>> session.save(minister)
  >>> session.flush()
  
  
  >>> minister2 = model.Minister()
  >>> minister2.group_id = ministry.group_id
  >>> minister2.user_id = mp_2.user_id
  >>> session.save(minister2)
  >>> session.flush()  
  
Questions
---------

  >>> from bungeni.models.domain import Question
  >>> question = Question()

  >>> question.owner_id = user.user_id
  >>> question.receive_notification = False
  
Question received.
  
  >>> notification.sendNotificationToMemberUponReceipt(ObjectEvent(question))

Let's change our setting for receive notification so an email message
is dispatched.
