Bill Workflow
=============

The default bill workflow models the Westminister Tradition.

Setup
-----

  >>> from bungeni.core.domain import Bill
  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.bill import states
  >>> import bungeni.core.interfaces
  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow, IWorkflowInfo
  >>> import ore.workflow
  
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.WorkflowState,
  ...    (bungeni.core.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.bill.BillWorkflowAdapter,
  ...    (Bill,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    ore.workflow.workflow.WorkflowInfo,
  ...    (Bill,))
  
  >>> def transitions(content):
  ...     wf = IWorkflow(content)
  ...     return tuple(transition.transition_id for transition in wf.getTransitions( content.status ) )

Drafting A Bill
---------------

A bill can be submitted by either a private member or a ministry, we've labled these below as a private
or public bill respectively.

  >>> private_bill = Bill()
  >>> public_bill  = Bill()

The application is responsible for transition bills to their initial state, depending on their method
of creation.
  
  >>> public_bill.status = states.ministry_draft
  >>> transitions( public_bill )
  ('ministry-submit',)

A ministry member can then submit a bill, as long as they have the corresponding 
'bungeni.bill.MinistrySubmit' permission.

  >>> public_bill.workflow.fireTransition('ministry-submit')
  >>> public_bill.status
  'submitted'

The process is simliar to for a private member submitting a bill, although with different transition
names ( the ui labels on these are the same).

  >>> private_bill.status = states.member_draft
  >>> transitions(private_bill)
  ('member-submit',)
  >>> private_bill.workflow.fireTransition('member-submit')
  >>> private_bill.status
  'submitted'

From this point the workflow for the two types of bills is the same.

First Reading
-------------
First step for a bill is to be scheduled for a public reading, the user interface
presents a transition specific ui viewlet to be used for scheduling the reading.

  >>> private_bill.workflow.fireTransition('schedule-first')
  >>> transitions( private_bill )
  ('schedule-second', 'select-first-committee')
 
  >>> public_bill.workflow.fireTransition('schedule-first')
  >>> transitions( public_bill )
  ('schedule-second', 'select-first-committee')

Committees
----------

Next step, optionally is to send the bill to a committee. After a bill is 
sent to committee, it can either be scheduled for a second reading, or
for the committee's report to be read.
  
  >>> public_bill.workflow.fireTransition('select-first-committee')
  >>> transitions( public_bill )
  ('schedule-first-report-reading', 'schedule-second-from-first-committee')
  

Second Reading
--------------

We can then schedule a second reading, again in the ui, this presents a workflow
viewlet for scheduling the bill.
 
  >>> private_bill.workflow.fireTransition('schedule-second')
  >>> transitions( private_bill )
  ('select-second-committee', 'schedule-whole-house')
