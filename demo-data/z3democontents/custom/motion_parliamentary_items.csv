<li>having regard to Rule 103(2) of its Rules of Procedure,</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>whereas the commonly shared belief of political and business leaders and mainstream economists that 'free markets know better' and that the free interplay of market forces guarantees an efficient and effective allocation of resources has been strongly disproved by the financial and economic crisis,</li>
<li>whereas the increasing inequality in the distribution of income and wealth (rising profits and wealth, steep decline of labour's share in national income) in the last 30 years was the major driving force behind the giant growth of investment in financial markets and the creation of asset price bubbles,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>whereas the globalisation, liberalisation and deregulation of financial markets have paved the way for financial innovation (derivatives, hedge funds, private equity, securitisation, structured investment vehicles, etc), which in turn has led to excessive and excessively pro-cyclical leverage, short-term behaviour, imposing untenable targets for high rates of return on enterprises in the context of production and services ('shareholder value orientation'), and fast and widespread contagion of risks; whereas, therefore, both the neo-liberal policies of financial market liberalisation and the short-term orientation of increasing shareholder value at any cost have proved to be entirely bankrupt,</li>
<li>whereas the blame for the crisis lies not only with greedy managers in the financial industry but, equally, with the governments of the US and of nearly all the EU Member States as well as with the EU institutions, all of which have promoted the liberalisation of financial markets, in the EU notably with the EU Financial Market Action Plan and the Lamfalussy package, which were based on 'self-regulation' by the financial sector,</li>
<li>whereas the current crisis underlines the need to combine the economic and political power of the entire world in order to tackle the crisis by means of coordinated fiscal policies and to curb the financial markets; whereas the traditional 'western world', especially the US, Japan and the EU, is no longer able to solve the problems single-handedly; whereas the G20 summit was therefore expected to launch a new world economic order, with an important role for the emerging countries,</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>whereas ten years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam:<br><ul>
<li>the EU acquis on justice, freedom and security has been growing significantly, thereby confirming the choice made by the Member States to involve the European Union institutions extensively in policy-making in this area so as to ensure freedom, security and justice to Union citizens,</li>
<li>a majority of Union citizens, according to Eurobarometer periodic surveys, increasingly feel that EU-level actions have an added value compared to those taken solely at a national level and two thirds of citizens support EU-level actions which promote and protect fundamental rights (including children’s rights), as well as the fight against organised crime and terrorism, and only 18% consider that EU-level actions have had no extra benefit,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>whereas the positive factors mentioned above cannot offset:<br><ul>
<li>the persistent legal weakness and complexity of the EU decision-making process, notably in areas such as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, which lack an appropriate democratic and judicial control at EU level,</li>
<li>the reluctance of a majority of the Member States to strengthen policies linked to fundamental rights and citizens' rights; at the same time it appears increasingly essential to focus not only on cross-border cases, in order to avoid double standards within the same Member State,</li>
<li>the continuing need to further develop and correctly implement the EU common immigration and asylum policy, which is facing delays in relation to the timetable agreed on in the Hague Programme and the European Immigration and Asylum Pact,</li>
<li>the difficulties faced by the Commission in ensuring the timely and correct implementation of much recently adopted Community legislation, together with managing a high volume of correspondence, complaints and a growing infringements case-load,</li>
<li>the need for a more extensive involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments in assessing the real impact of EU legislation on the ground,</li>
<li>the still underdeveloped network of representatives of civil society and stakeholders in each AFSJ policy; it is worth noting that only recently the Ministers of Justice of the Member States decided to build a network aimed at mutually strengthening their national legislation and the same should be done for the other AFSJ areas,</li>
<li>the fact that, even between EU agencies, cooperation is developing slowly and the situation risks becoming even more complex with the multiplication of other bodies with operational tasks at EU level,</li>
