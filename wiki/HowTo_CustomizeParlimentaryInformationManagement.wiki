Bungeni language configuration is managed in this file:
{{{
{BUNGENI_INSTALL_PATH}/src/bungeni_custom/__init__.py. 
}}}
The location of this file may be different if you have a custom configuration location. (See [HowTo_CustomizeParlimentaryInformationManagement#Using_the_customization_folder Using the customization folder])

The parameters in the snippet below will be found in this file and determine how languages are handled in Bungeni and are discussed below.

{{{
# language ids, either as a space-separated string or as a list of strings
zope_i18n_allowed_languages = "ar en es es-do fr it nl pt ru sw tk" 

# boolean: True, False
zope_i18n_compile_mo_files = True 

# string, language identifier, must be one of zope_i18n_allowed_languages
default_language = "en"

# language ids for languages written right to left, as a space-separated string
right_to_left_languages = "ar" 
}}}

=== Setting the default language for the system ===
The system's default language can be set via the parameter *default_language* which is one of the language codes in the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.
This language will be used in the Bungeni user interface if the user has not chosen another language from the language menu or the browser language is not one of *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.

=== Enabling other languages ===
To enable or disable languages, add or remove language codes from the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*. 

Only enabled languages will show up in Bungeni's languages menu. With the settings above, this will be the the language menu:

http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/languages-menu.png

=== Other language settings ===
The parameter *zope_i18n_compile_mo_files* determines if message catalogs are compiled to a binary format.

To specify the languages for which the user interface should be rendered right-to-left, add or remove languages from *right_to_left_languages*.

== Layout, theme and formats == 
The layout, look and feel of the portal is controlled by a theme template in conjunction with a set of css styles and rule files. A default theme is enabled for each Bungeni installation.

=== Enabling a country theme ===

Sample country themes exist at this location: http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/portal.country_themes/trunk

To enable a country theme, edit the country_theme parameter in the Fabric 'setup.ini' file. The default setting is as follows:

{{{
[custom]
...
country_theme = default
}}}

Set this parameter to the appropriate value (_It is recommended to use the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes_) e.g. for the Kenya theme the setting would be as follows:

{{{
[custom]
...
country_theme = ke
}}}

then run the following command in fabric


{{{
fab -H localhost enable_country_theme config_ini:portal 
}}}

=== Changing page layout ===   
=== Changing the Menu Order and Structure ===   

=== Styling with CSS  ===  

folder structure:

{{{
|-- css
|-- images
|-- js
`-- themes
    |-- layout.html
    `-- rules.xml
}}}

The CSS files for styling Bungeni are broken down into two files.

_reset.css_ and _skin.css_

  * reset.css - Has styling properties that affect width, height and alignment of Bungeni.

  * skin.css - Cosmetic changes such as text-color, background-color, border, typography are done here. 

styling in both CSS files is split into four major sections:

  * GENERAL - Applies site-wide
  * TEMPLATE-PORTAL - Anonymous user-space or public view
  * TEMPLATE-WORKSPACE - Logged in area
  * TEMPLATE-PORTAL-EXIST - Public view from an XML repository

Denoted at the start by a comment banner. e.g. for TEMPLATE-PORTAL

{{{
/* =============================================================================
   TEMPLATE PORTAL - Styling applied on portal
   ========================================================================== */
}}}

These are top-level class selector's found on the HTML `body` tag e.g. `<body class="template-portal">`

To increase width of the portal from the default `960px`.

_reset.css_ -> find `template-portal` top-level section and look under width sub-section

Similar process for change background-color albeit under the _skin.css_ file

=== Theming Bungeni using Skins ===  

Bungeni skins are located under the custom folder:

{{{
{BUNGENI_INSTALL_PATH}/src/bungeni_custom/ 
}}}
