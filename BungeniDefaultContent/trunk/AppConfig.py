Investigations carried out led to the arrest of three hospital staff, who have been charged and the case is pending before Migori Senior Magistrate's Court.</p> <p>I am also aware that electric calculators worth Kshs2,900 and a typewriter worth Kshs59,800 were stolen. The reports were made to the Migori Police Station but to date no arrests or recoveries have been made. </p> <p>In April 1995, a new photocopier worth Kshs289,000 was stolen and investigations by police officers led to the arrest of four hospital staff and recovery of the photocopier. The officers have been charged and the Ministry interdicted them. The case is still pending before the court. </p> <p>The watchman who was on duty has since been charged and the case is pending before Migori court. The total value of all these stolen items is Kshs455,190.</p> </li> <li>The measures the Ministry has taken to curb the thefts are:- <ul id="ul6"> <li>The institution of strict control measures on delivery, storage and issuing of drugs, medical supplies and equipment.</li> <li>The hospital has now been fenced.</li> <li>The drug store has been burglar-proofed.</li> <li>The staff suspected of being involved in thefts have been reshuffled.</li> <li>The County Council staff who were staying in the hospital compound premises have been removed.</li> <li>The Administration Police Officers have been deployed to guard the hospital compound.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Just before I allow Members to ask supplementary questions, Mr. Assistant Minister, you said in part (a) that there are some cases in court. Do you have the case numbers and who are the parties?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not <span class="unknown">Mr. Criticos</span> have the relevant information regarding the parties concerned but, obviously, it is the Ministry of Health versus the culprits.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Achola"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Assistant Minister has tried to hide some of the facts by understating the actual amount involved. He has only talked about Kshs450,000, but my records show that over Kshs13 million has been stolen. Could the Assistant Minister inform the House as to what exactly is going on? When will these people be charged and what is the case number of the people involved? The thefts in Migori hospital have been going on for a long time and nothing seems to be happening. Thieves are being recycled, as he puts it, and this is not good enough for our people.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to ask the hon. Member to give me a copy of his records which indicate theft of equipment worth Kshs13 million. I really would like that information because we, in the Ministry, are not aware. Secondly, about the reshuffling of the people, we cannot discharge people from the service of the Ministry when they have not been caught red-handed and when there is no evidence against them by which they can be charged in court. So, if there is any doubt, we try and move them to other areas because they have not been proven guilty. Therefore, we cannot assume someone is guilty.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Aluoch"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the answer given by the Assistant Minister, part (v) states that the County Council staff who are staying in the hospital compound premises have been removed. This is misleading the House. Only last Monday, we were attending a DDC meeting and we were discussing when the County Council staff will leave the hospital compound because, this is what is contributing to the thefts as well. </p> <p>The Chairman of the County Council is still there, the Clerk to the Council and the rest of the Council staff are occupying the houses that the hospital staff should be using. They cannot even install an X-ray machine because the council staff are still in the compound. What are you going to do to remove them instead of telling us that they are not there? Stop misleading this House!</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not aware that the County Council is using Ministry of Health houses. If the hon. Member can furnish us with the names of the people concerned, the Ministry will then take the appropriate action to evict them.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Nthenge"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do you not agree with me that the hon. Member has told the Assistant Minister even the titles of the people occupying these houses? One is the Town Clerk, the other one is the Chairman of the County Council. What other information does he need?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> I agree with you!</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got two names; the Town Clerk and the Chairman of the County Council. I do not know whether these are the only ones or there are others. I was just asking about the others. You have my assurance that those people will be evicted immediately.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Achola"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think I would like the Assistant Minister to assure this House that something is going to be done to stop the theft of drugs from Migori Hospital. Even the local pharmacies around are selling, in broad daylight, drugs from Government Stores and nothing is being done about that. The police are not arresting anybody. What are you going to do, Mr. Assistant Minister?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said, on numerous occasions, that we would like support from the local community. They should also keep a watchful eye on these people. I have given you six measures that we have taken to stop the theft of drugs. However, the local community and the medical board which is there should also be actively involved in looking after our drugs because they belong to us in general.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Next Question, Mr. Moiben.</p> </div> </div> <div class="subdivision" id="que801"> <div class="title">COMMISSIONING OF HEALTH CENTRE</div> <div class="question" by="Moiben" to="MH"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p>Mr. Moiben asked the Minister for Health</p> <ul id="ul7"> <li>when Saboti Health Centre will be operational and officially opened; and,</li> <li>when the Health Centre will be supplied with electricity.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="answer" as="AMH" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</p> <ul id="ul8"> <li>My Ministry intended to complete and operationalize Saboti Health Centre during the 1994/95 financial year. However, due to the inadequate funds and escalation of the costs over the period of 1991 - 93, the project could not be completed as planned and it is about 95 per cent complete. The project period expired and, hence, there is no provision in the current financial year for the remaining funds to be allocated. My Ministry is in the process of obtaining funds to fully complete and equip the health centre, after which it will be operational and officially opened.</li> <li>Within the present contract for the health centre, there is a provision for a generator which should be adequate to provide electricity for <span class="unknown">The Assistant Minister for Health</span> the services that will require electricity. Electricity will, therefore, be supplied to the health centre as soon as funds for the installation of generators are provided.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="speech" by="Moiben"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trans-Nzoia DDC approved that electricity be supplied to this hospital way back in 1991. Can the Assistant Minister confirm when this will be done? The hospital was 95 per cent completed way back in 1991.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Criticos"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, like I said earlier, when the funds are allocated, this will be done. We cannot supply electricity without funds.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Next Question, Mr. Nyagah!</p> </div> </div> <div class="subdivision" id="que605"> <div class="title">LOANS FOR GACHOKA RESIDENTS</div> <div class="question" by="Nyagah" to="MCI"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p>Mr. Nyagah asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry</p> <ul id="ul9"> <li>when he will consider extending trade loan facilities to the people of Gachoka Constituency to enable them start small businesses; and,</li> <li>how many traders from Gachoka were given such loans between 1988 and 1995.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="answer" by="Barmasai" as="AMCI"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</p> <ul id="ul10"> <li>Trade loan facilities have already been extended to the people of Gachoka Constituency.</li> <li>Over 200 traders have received such loans between 1988 and 1995.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="speech" by="Nyagah"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the year 2000, there will be 33 million people in Kenya. To alleviate rural-urban migration, we need to look after that group that lives in the rural areas so that they do not feel the need to move into the urban areas. How much of that money was given to the 200 people between 1988 and 1995, given the fact that the Government provision for this, in any given year, is not more than K£250,000? If you were to divide that per province, each province is entitled to less than K£62,500?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Barmasai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really depends on what the hon. Member refers to when he talks of small businesses. If it includes small industries, then what they have been given is Kshs24 million.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Maore"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister confirm or deny that nearly all of the 200 members he has talked about are those people who received the Kenya Rural Enterprise legal peanuts ranging between Kshs5,000 and Kshs10,000, just prior to the 1992 election campaigns?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Barmasai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 200 people I am referring to are those ones who got the loan from the Joint Loans Board and the Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE) and Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC) for small industries.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Nyagah"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is of great concern to Kenyans. We need to empower the small businessmen at home. That is what the economy is dependent on. </p> <p>Can the Assistant Minister break up what was given in form of loans by the KIE, and what was given in form of trade loans by the Joint Loans Board between 1988 and 1993 so that we can see the difference between the two?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Barmasai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Joint Loans Board gave Kshs737,000 for the whole of that period. The KIE gave Kshs12,154,100.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Mwaura"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister mentioned Kshs 24 million as money given out in form of a loan. Was this money given to Gachoka Constituency, Embu, or to the whole country?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Barmasai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question concerned Gachoka Constituency and, therefore, those figures are for Gachoka Constituency.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Nyagah"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that Kshs 24 million was extended to Gachoka. I have then asked him to give me a breakdown of this figure and he was very good to give me the breakdown as follows:- Kshs 737,000 in form of trade loans and Kshs 12 million. So is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead Kenyans that Kshs 24 million was given whereas in seven years, they only gave Kshs 12 million and Kshs 700,000?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Barmasai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was answering his supplementary question exactly as he asked it. He asked for the breakdown of the money for Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE) and Joint Loans Board.

Traffic census by the Ministry along this road indicate that the road does not meet the maximum requirement for tarmacking. Under the circumstances, therefore, it was decided that the road be murrammed. In fact, there is a contractor on site and the work is actually completed.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Shikuku"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that funny reply from the Assistant Minister, with a bit of truth in it, is he aware that this was a top priority of the DDC, Kakamega, and it was recommended many years ago based on the traffic on this road? Since when did this traffic reduce and this Government had a second thoughts?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Kiluta"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a pity that the hon. Member does not have the details with him. If he would be kind enough and accept correction, the traffic on that road averages 135 vehicles a day.

Now that in his reply he has said that the road will be completed by 30th September, 1995, is he aware that the road has not been completed? Which September is he talking about? This is October and the road is not completed. They are now murramming it. Is he in order to tell the house untruths?

Member to accept the answer given.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> For the second time, Mr. Kofa's Question.</p> </div> </div> <div class="subdivision" id="que803"> <div class="title">BANDITRY MENACE IN GALOLE</div> <div class="question" by="Kofa" to="MS"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p>Mr. Kofa asked the Minister of State, Office of the President</p> <ul id="ul11"> <li>whether he is aware that Councillor Abdi Sole of Asako Location was seriously injured and two homeguards were shot dead and their guns stolen while pursuing bandits on 20th May, 1995;</li> <li>who instructed these people to pursue the heavily armed bandits; and,</li> <li>whether he can ensure that the families of the deceased <span class="unknown">Mr. Kofa</span> homeguards are compensated and that Councillor Sole's medical expenses are paid in full.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="answer" as="AMS" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologise for not having answered the Question the first time. Now, I beg to give the following reply. </p> <p>I am aware that on 2nd June, 1995 and not on the 20th May, 1995, Councillor Abdi Sole of Asako Location in company of other councillors, assistant chief Mohammed Farah Wachu and home guards were attacked by bandits at a manyatta in Ditole area during which two home guards were shot dead and the councillor Sole injured. </p> <p>The assistant chief and the home guards were in normal security patrol of the area when they were attacked by the bandits and the question of compensation to the family of the deceased home guards and payment of medical expenses for councillor Abdi Sole is being studied in my office and appropriate action will be taken when this is over.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Kofa"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not received the written reply, but if I listened carefully to the reply to part "b" of my Question, the Assistant Minister said "the chief and the home guards were in normal security patrol of the area". That means that the Assistant Minister has accepted that they got into problems while they were on duty. This councillor is maimed and can no longer fend for this family. Can the Assistant Minister confirm therefore that this maimed councillor and the two home guards that were killed will be compensated and could he tell us when this is going to be?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member will appreciate that this incident involves the assistant chief, a homeguard as well as a politician and so on; and we are trying to study the legality of compensating each one of them. </p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Wako"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for the answer given that they are going to consider the case but how long will his consideration take because this is a problem which is affecting the whole of Northern Kenya?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member who is a friend of mine will appreciate that if he came to the Office of the President this issue can always be speeded up and especially if he presents the case of his constituents fast enough.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Farah"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister earlier in which he said that home guards are issued with fire arms under the Firearms Act which is not true because there is no provision in the Firearms Act to create militia. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why we cannot have a crack anti-banditry squad which is saved and that is in a position to track down this bandits on foot instead of putting the lives of innocent Kenyans who do not have proper training at risk whereby they are killed by bandits.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> I hope hon. Farah is not actually implying that where he comes from they do need home guards. I am sure he does and he must also appreciate that in the past we have told him in this House that we are prepared to consider that possibility that he has presented.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Farah"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That undertaking was given by the Assistant Minister when I first came into this House three years ago. Could he tell us how much longer he needs to be given for him to select very modest young men from the existing forces who are Somalis, Turkanas, Masais or Pokots; people who are used to doing that kind of thing and use them as a crack squad to combact these bandits? How much longer does he need to constitute that small squad everywhere in the districts of the former NFD including Tana River?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> At least, the hon. Member has been honest enough to admit that we have given him the undertaking.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Kofa"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> After the killings of these two home guards and maiming the Councillors, the bandits took their guns away. A week later, these guns were brought by elders, which means these elders knew who the bandits were. What action has the Assistant Minister taken to arrest these bandits?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Sunkuli"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> We have not gotten the bandits yet. It is true the guns were recovered.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Falana"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister says that they have not apprehended the bandits yet, but the guns were recovered. Could he be transparent enough to tell this House how the guns were recovered without the bearers being there? If these bandits were not killed or captured, how did the elders get the guns?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> That is a supplementary question. Next Question, Mr. R.K. Mungai for the second time.</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Mungai"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask this Question, I beg to apologise to the House for not being here when the Question was first called.</p> </div> </div> <div class="subdivision" id="que630b"> <div class="title">DEATH OF MS.

Mungai</span> Anne Wairimu Mungai, aged 23 years, from Makuyu Location, Makuyu Constituency, die at the Thika District Hospital on Thursday 8th June, 1995 after being admitted under reference OBS/NO.4306; and, </li> <li>whether he could inform the House, the names, qualifications and relevant experience, respectively, of all the senior medical staff who attended the late Ms Anne Wairimu Muiruri of which I have not had a written reply.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="answer" as="MH" by="Angatia"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the reply is on the way.

It is about the answer being "on the way". According to the Standing Orders, the replies to Questions are supposed to be here five minutes before the sitting. When the bell rings, they are supposed to be here already. Now he is saying the answer is "on the way". Which way? How long will it take to reach here?</p> </div> <div class="speech" by="Smith" as="S"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Order! Order! The Minister will reply to that, but to be honest with you, I do not even know how a question or an answer can be "on the way".</p> </div> <div class="answer" as="MH" by="Angatia"> <div class="from">Mr. Kofa</div> <p> Mr. Speaker, Sir, his pigeonhole is part of the way. </p> <ul id="ul14"> <li>I have quite a long answer because this involves the life of a person. The late Anne Wairimu Muiruri was admitted to Thika District Hospital Maternity Ward on 4th June, 1995 with obstructed labour. She had been in labour for a very long time at home and was only brought to the hospital after failing to deliver since the baby was too big and was lying in a breach position. She was prepared for caesarian section operation which was carried out a few hours later on the morning of 5th June, 1995. Post operatively, she developed bacterial infection due to prolonged obstructed labour at home. She was also diagnosed to have malaria. Despite antibiotics and anti-malaria treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died on the 8th June, 1995. However, the timely action by the medical staff saved the baby's life and we hope the baby is still alive. </li> <li>The name, qualifications and relevant experiences of the senior staff who attended the late Ms. Anne Wairimu Muiruri are here but the list is very long and I do not know whether I am supposed to read the whole of it. The team was led by a Consultant Dr. W. Mugo, a doctor of medicine for 11 years.

However, the reply has arrived eventually, but the Minister said certain things which I did quite follow, but which are not in the reply. Be that as it may, could the Minister confirm or deny that Ms. Muiruri died due to professional negligence on the part of those carrying out the operation? From the reply, it appears that she did not have any abnormal disease or complication and that malaria and bacterial infections could have been contained. Did the patient not have foreign bodies left in the operational area?
