Motion workflow
===============

  >>> from bungeni.models.domain import Motion
  >>> import bungeni.models as model
  >>> import datetime
  
  some setup for tests

   >>> from zope import component
   >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   >>> from ore.alchemist.interfaces import IDatabaseEngine
   >>> from ore.alchemist import Session
   >>> from bungeni.models import domain, schema
   
Setting up Database Connection and Utilities:
   >>> import bungeni.core.testing as testing
   >>> testing.setup_db()   
   >>> session = Session()
   >>> i = 0


Setup
-----

  >>> import bungeni.core.workflows.adapters
  >>> import bungeni.core.interfaces
  >>> import bungeni.models.interfaces  
  >>> import ore.workflow
  >>> import copy
  
  >>> import bungeni.core.workflows.testing
  >>> bungeni.core.workflows.testing.setup_adapters()
  >>> bungeni.core.workflows.testing.setup_security_adapters()

  
  >>> from zope.interface import classImplements
  >>> classImplements( bungeni.models.domain.Motion, bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersionable)  
  
Transition events
-----------------

We set up event subscribers to make sure all registered transition
events are called.

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows import testing
  >>> check_transition_events = testing.provide_transition_events_check(
  ...     bungeni.core.workflows.motion.wf)
  
Workflow
--------

  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow, IWorkflowInfo
  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.testing import transitions, permission, schedule_item



Sitting to schedule the motion:
-----------------------------
  >>> st = model.SittingType()
  >>> st.sitting_type = u"morning"
  >>> st.start_time = datetime.time(8,30)
  >>> st.end_time = datetime.time(12,30)  
  >>> session.save(st)
  >>> session.flush()

  >>> st.sitting_type_id
  1L
 
  >>> sit1 = model.GroupSitting()
  >>> sit1.start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
  >>> sit1.end_date = datetime.datetime.now()
  >>> sit1.sitting_type = st.sitting_type_id
  >>> session.save(sit1)
  >>> session.flush() 

  >>> motion = Motion()
  >>> session.save(motion)
  >>> session.flush()

First we initialize the workflow.
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'create',)

  >>> permission(motion)
  (Global(CheckerPublic,zope.security.checker),)

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('create')

The motion is now in a draft state.


  >>> transitions(motion)
   (u'submit-to-clerk',)
    
  >>> permission(motion)
  (u'bungeni.motion.Submit',)


When we submit the motion, a new version is created.
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('submit-to-clerk')

The transition action returns None, indicating that the the current
instance is still active.

  >>> result is None
  True

Verify that a new version was issued.

  >>> from bungeni.core.interfaces import IVersioned
  >>> versions = IVersioned(motion)
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
  

Let's examine the version.

  >>> version = list(versions.values())[0]
  >>> version.status
  u'motionstates.draft'

Submitted:

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'withdraw-submitted', u'received-by-clerk')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-submitted')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'  

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')


Received:

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'require-edit-by-mp', u'complete', u'withdraw-received')
  
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True  

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-received')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'  
  
  

  
If it needs clarification this sets it back to draft and it must be submitted again  
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('require-edit-by-mp')
  

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'resubmit-clerk', u'withdraw-amend')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
    
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')
  
versioned again
  
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
      
    
  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')
  
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True  
    
complete the motion

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('complete')  

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True    
  
The speakers office now has to review the motion

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-complete')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'


Reject the motion

  >>> motion_reject = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> transitions(motion_reject)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_reject).fireTransition('reject') 

  >>> transitions(motion_reject)
  ()     

If the motions requires amendment it is sent back to the owner
and has to be resubmitted 

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> motion_amend = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('require-amendment')   
  
it gets versioned before amendment
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
    
  
  >>> transitions(motion_amend)
  (u'complete-clarify', u'mp-clarify')

The clerks office can resubmit the motion

  >>> motion_clerk_resubmit = copy.deepcopy(motion_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_clerk_resubmit).fireTransition('complete-clarify')    
  >>> transitions(motion_clerk_resubmit)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')


or the motion can be send back to the mp for further clarification

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('mp-clarify')  
  >>> transitions(motion_amend)
  (u'resubmit-clerk', u'withdraw-amend')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True



A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-amend')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'


  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')  

it gets versioned by resubmitting after amendment
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
  

  >>> transitions(motion_amend)   
  (u'withdraw-submitted', u'received-by-clerk')

clerks recieves it

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')  


  
Appove the motion

  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('approve')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'defer', u'withdraw-admissible', u'schedule')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-admissible')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'


defer the motion

  >>> motion_defer = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_defer).fireTransition('defer')   
  
  >>> transitions(motion_defer)     
  (u'schedule-deferred', u'elapse-defered',  u'withdraw-deferred')
  
  
  
A motion can elapse if no answer is given
  >>> motion_elapse_defered = copy.deepcopy(motion_defer)
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_elapse_defered).fireTransition('elapse-defered')    
  >>> transitions(motion_elapse_defered)
  ()

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion_defer)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-deferred')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'  
   
  >>> schedule_item(motion_defer, sit1)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_defer).fireTransition('schedule-deferred')   
  >>> transitions(motion_defer)     
  (u'postpone', u'debate', u'withdraw-scheduled')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_defer).fireTransition('postpone')   

schedule the motion
  >>> schedule_item(motion, sit1)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('schedule')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'postpone', u'debate', u'withdraw-scheduled')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-scheduled')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'

postpone the motion
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('postpone')  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'schedule-postponed', u'elapse-postponed', u'withdraw-postponed')
 
A motion can elapse without an answer 

  >>> motion_elapse_postponed = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_elapse_postponed).fireTransition('elapse-postponed')   
  >>> transitions(motion_elapse_postponed)
  ()
  
A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-postponed')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'motionstates.withdrawn'

and reschedule it

  >>> schedule_item(motion, sit1)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('schedule-postponed')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  (u'postpone', u'debate', u'withdraw-scheduled')



The motion was debated

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('debate')  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ()



Transition events check
-----------------------

  >>> check_transition_events ==  {(u'motionstates.complete', u'motionstates.inadmissible'): True, 
  ... (u'motionstates.admissible', u'motionstates.deferred'): True, 
  ... (u'motionstates.admissible', u'motionstates.scheduled'): True,

Notifications
-------------

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows import motion as notification
  >>> from zope.component.interfaces import ObjectEvent

Setup mock delivery component.

  >>> import zope.sendmail.interfaces
  
  >>> class MockMailDelivery(object):
  ...     interface.implements(zope.sendmail.interfaces.IMailDelivery)
  ...
  ...     def send(self, *args):
  ...         print "From: %s\nTo: %s\n\n%s" % args

  >>> component.provideUtility(MockMailDelivery())

Set up a user.

Motion received.
  
  >>> notification.SendNotificationToMemberUponReceipt(ObjectEvent(motion))

Let's change our setting for receive notification so an email message
is dispatched.

  >>> notification.SendNotificationToMemberUponReceipt(ObjectEvent(motion))
  From: clerks.office@parliament.go.tld
  To: "John Doe" <john.doe@localhost>...
  Subject: Motion received: My subject...
  
Send notification to Clerk's office upon submit.
#XXX
Note that the notification setting for the clerks office are
HARDCODED in the preferences so we cannot test this yet!
