Question and response workflow
==============================

Setup
-----

Setting up database connection and utilities:

  >>> from bungeni.core.testing import setup_db
  >>> engine = setup_db()
  
  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.testing import setup_adapters
  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.testing import setup_security_adapters
  >>> setup_adapters()
  >>> setup_security_adapters()
  
  >>> from bungeni.alchemist import Session
  >>> session = Session()
  
Imports.

  >>> from bungeni.models import domain
  >>> from bungeni.models import schema

Questions are versionable.
  
  >>> from zope.interface import classImplements
  >>> from bungeni.core.interfaces import IVersionable
  >>> classImplements(domain.Question, IVersionable)

Principals
----------

In order to create a participation, we need a principal:

  >>> from bungeni.core.testing import create_principal, create_participation
  >>> import zope.security.management
  >>> zope.security.management.endInteraction()

  >>> member = create_principal("member", "Member", ())
  >>> clerk = create_principal("clerk", "Clerk", ())
  >>> speaker = create_principal("speaker", "Speaker", ())
  >>> minister_1 = create_principal("minister 1", "Minister", ())
  >>> minister_2 = create_principal("minister 2", "Minister", ())

Assign roles.

  >>> global_prm = zope.securitypolicy.interfaces.IPrincipalRoleMap(app)
  >>> global_prm.assignRoleToPrincipal(u"bungeni.MP", "member")
  >>> global_prm.assignRoleToPrincipal(u"bungeni.Clerk", "clerk")
  >>> global_prm.assignRoleToPrincipal(u"bungeni.Speaker", "speaker")
  >>> global_prm.assignRoleToPrincipal(u"bungeni.Minister", "minister 1")
  >>> global_prm.assignRoleToPrincipal(u"bungeni.Minister", "minister 2")


Content creation
----------------

  >>> from bungeni.models.testing import add_content

  >>> parliament = add_content(
  ...    domain.Parliament,
  ...    short_name=u"p_1",
  ...    language="en",
  ...    start_date=yesterday,
  ...    election_date=yesterday)

  >>> gov = add_content(
  ...    domain.Government,
  ...    short_name=u"gov_1",
  ...    language="en",
  ...    start_date=yesterday,
  ...    parliament_id=parliament.parliament_id)
  
  >>> ministry = add_content(
  ...    domain.Ministry,
  ...    short_name=u"ministry",
  ...    language="en",
  ...    start_date=yesterday,
  ...    parent_group_id=gov.group_id)
 

We need a parliament, government ministry and ministers to whom we can
send the question notifications.

  >>> country = add_content(
  ...    domain.Country,
  ...    country_id="KE",
  ...    iso_name = u"KENYA",
  ...    language="en",
  ...    country_name=u"Kenya")
  
  >>> mp_1 = add_content(
  ...    domain.User,
  ...    u"minister 1",
  ...    first_name=u"a", 
  ...    last_name=u"ab", 
  ...    birth_country="KE",
  ...    email=u"mp1@example.com", 
  ...    date_of_birth=today,
  ...    language="en",
  ...    gender="M")
  
  >>> mp_2 = add_content(
  ...    domain.User,
  ...    u"minister 2",
  ...    first_name=u"b", 
  ...    last_name=u"bc", 
  ...    birth_country="KE",
  ...    date_of_birth=today,
  ...    email=u"mp2@example.com",
  ...    language="en",
  ...    gender="M")
  
  >>> mp_3 = add_content(
  ...    domain.User,
  ...    u"member",
  ...    first_name=u"c", 
  ...    birth_country="KE",
  ...    last_name=u"cd",
  ...    date_of_birth=today,
  ...    email=u"mp3@example.com", 
  ...    language="en",
  ...    gender="F")
  
  >>> question = add_content(
  ...     domain.Question,
  ...     short_name=u"My subject",
  ...     body_text=u"The question",
  ...     owner_id = mp_3.user_id,
  ...     language="en")
  >>> question.__parent__ = app
  
  >>> from bungeni.models.testing import create_sitting
  >>> sitting = create_sitting(parliament.parliament_id, "en")

Set up a security mapping.

  >>> from zope.securitypolicy.interfaces import IPrincipalRoleMap
  >>> qprm = zope.securitypolicy.interfaces.IPrincipalRoleMap(question)

  >>> #from zope.securitypolicy.interfaces import IRolePermissionMap  
  >>> from bungeni.alchemist.security import LocalRolePermissionMap
  >>> qrpm = LocalRolePermissionMap(question)
  
Integrity
---------

Verify that all states are reachable.

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.testing import verify_workflow
  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow
  
  >>> wf = IWorkflow(question)
  >>> verify_workflow(wf)

Questions transitions 
-------------------------------------

  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflowInfo
  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows.question import actions 
  >>> info = IWorkflowInfo(question)
  >>> info
  <bungeni.core.workflows.states.StateWorkflowInfo object at ...>

PRINCIPAL: member

  >>> zope.security.management.newInteraction(create_participation(member))
  >>> from bungeni.models.utils import get_principal_id
  >>> get_principal_id()
  'member'

-------------------------------------
Transition: "create" - assigns the role of "Owner" and sets the parliament id.

  #>>> actions.create(info, question)
  >>> info.fireTransition("create")
  >>> question.status
  'draft'

  >>> question.parliament_id==parliament.parliament_id
  True
  
  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("member"))
  ((u'bungeni.Owner', PermissionSetting: Allow),)
  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("clerk"))
  ()
  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("speaker"))
  ()
  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("minister 1"))
  ()
  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("minister 2"))
  ()


PERMISSIONS for member principal for "draft" question.status

  >>> from zope.security import checkPermission
  >>> [ checkPermission("bungeni.question.Edit", question), 
  ...   checkPermission("bungeni.question.Add", question),
  ...   checkPermission("zope.View", question), 
  ...   checkPermission("bungeni.question.Delete", question), 
  ...   checkPermission("bungeni.fileattachment.Add", question), 
  ...   checkPermission("bungeni.fileattachment.Edit", question),
  ... ]
  [True, False, True, True, True, True]

TODO: also check permissions for other roles, i.e.
    <deny permission="zope.View" role="bungeni.Clerk" />
    <deny permission="zope.View" role="bungeni.Speaker" />
    <deny permission="zope.View" role="bungeni.Minister" />
    <deny permission="zope.View" role="bungeni.Everybody" /> 
    <deny permission="zope.View" role="bungeni.Anybody" />
this would require to run with an interaction, one with a participation that 
consists of a principal with the specific role.

TODO: also check Clerk create_on_behalf_of MP

-------------------------------------

Setup mock delivery component.

  >>> import zope.sendmail.interfaces
  
  >>> class MockMailDelivery(object):
  ...     interface.implements(zope.sendmail.interfaces.IMailDelivery)
  ...
  ...     def send(self, *args):
  ...         pass#print "From: %s\nTo: %s\n\n%s" % args

  >>> component.provideUtility(MockMailDelivery())

  >>> question.status
  'draft'
  
  >>> from bungeni.core.interfaces import IVersioned
  >>> versions = IVersioned(question)
  >>> len(versions)
  0

Transition: "submit_to_clerk"

  >>> #actions.submit_to_clerk(info, question)
  >>> info.fireTransition("submit_to_clerk-%s" % question.status)
  >>> question.status
  'submitted'
  >>> len(versions)
  1


!+FIRETRANSITION(mr, dec-2010) the above fireTransition works, but subsequent 
calls below do NOT work. This issue was claimed resolved, see this discussion:
http://groups.google.com/group/bungeni-dev/browse_thread/thread/11ed33aac12bd94e/d9c0c20967099cfd  


  >>> tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("member"))
  ((u'bungeni.Owner', PermissionSetting: Allow),)

  >>> #tuple(qprm.getRolesForPrincipal("clerk"))

  >>> #tuple(qrpm.getPermissionsForRole(u"bungeni.Owner"))
  >>> #tuple(qrpm.getRolesForPermission(u"bungeni.question.Edit"))

PRINCIPAL: clerk

Switch to the clerk, and check permission for Clerk on the question 
in "submitted" state:

  >>> zope.security.management.endInteraction()
  >>> zope.security.management.newInteraction(create_participation(clerk))
  >>> get_principal_id()
  'clerk'

-------------------------------------
Transition: "receive_by_clerk"

  >>> actions.received_by_clerk(info, question)
  >>> #info.fireTransition("receive_by_clerk-%s" % question.status)
  >>> #question.status
  #'received'
  >>> len(versions)
  2

# XXX-5 failing:

Notifications
-------------

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows import question as notification
  >>> from zope.component.interfaces import ObjectEvent

Setup mock delivery component.

  >>> import zope.sendmail.interfaces
  
  >>> class MockMailDelivery(object):
  ...     interface.implements(zope.sendmail.interfaces.IMailDelivery)
  ...
  ...     def send(self, *args):
  ...         print "From: %s\nTo: %s\n\n%s" % args

  >>> component.provideUtility(MockMailDelivery())

Set up a user.

  >>> user = add_content(
  ...     domain.User,
  ...     first_name=u"John",
  ...     last_name=u"Doe",
  ...     language="en",
  ...     email="john.doe@localhost")

  >>> _minister_1 = add_content(
  ...     domain.Minister,

  ...     user_id=mp_2.user_id)

  >>> question.receive_notification = False
  >>> question.owner_id = user.user_id
  
Question received.
  
  >>> notification.SendNotificationToMemberUponReceipt(ObjectEvent(question))

Let's change our setting for receive notification so an email message
is dispatched.

  >>> question.receive_notification = True
  >>> notification.SendNotificationToMemberUponReceipt(ObjectEvent(question))
