= Pre-Requisites for Bungeni =

The Bungeni Application system has the following pre-requisites :
 * User installed Python either Python 2.6 or Python 2.7;
 * SSL, Imaging, bz2 extensions for user installed Python;
 * System libraries required for building  PostgreSQL from source;
 * OpenOffice.org -- this is used for PDF conversion.

Recommended Linux distribution :
 * Ubuntu 10.04 (32 or 64 bit distro);
 * Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit distro) - *only runs Python 2.7*. 

The build process downloads various components from the internet - so it is *neccessary* for the computer to have access to the internet.

All of these pre-requisites can be automatically installed via a fabric setup script.

So, first we install Fabric - and run the pre-requisite setup scripts which installs all the required pre-requisites.
