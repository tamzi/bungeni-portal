The viewlet managers are:

  * version.manager in ui/version.zcml based on .version.VersionViewletManager
  * bungeni.subform.manager in ui/forms/configure.zcml base on viewlets.SubFormViewletManager
  * bungeni.scheduling in ui/viewlets/schedule.zcml with no declared class
  * bungeni.workspace in ui/viewlets/workspace.zcml based on zope.viewlet.manager.WeightOrderedViewletManager
  * bungeni.workspace-archive in ui/viewlets/workspace.zcml based on zope.viewlet.manager.WeightOrderedViewletManager

For 'version.manager' there is no 'version.py' module and it does not
include (the now deleted, circa [r8360](https://code.google.com/p/bungeni-portal/source/detail?r=8360)) 'version.zcml' in any zcml file.

'bungeni.scheduling', 'bungeni.workspace, 'bungeni.workspace-archive' are based
on standard viewlet manager.

The only manager doing filtering on viewlets is 'SubFormViewletManager' in
bungeni/ui/forms/viewlets.py
The class has a 'filter' method calling 'for\_display' on viewlets, but the only
viewlet using the workflow is SupplementaryQuestionsViewlet, the code is:

```
    @property
    def for_display(self):
        return self.context.__parent__.status == question_wf_state[u"response_submitted"].id
```
