TODO
####

* Cleanup code (we don't need to keep backward compat) to use Zope
  2.10/Plone 3.0.

* i18n cleanup and synch (mail to translators, see README.txt)

* Issue: Why can't we construct ExampleGlossary content in unit tests
  when it works using the UI (1 error in unit tests).

* Migrations from 1.3.3 (?)

* Have the definitions "wicked aware" is essential in a glossary, but
  Wiki support seems buggy since it doesn't work in ATCT anymore
  today.

* Remove the /content/schemata.py dispatch its code in content types
  modules and utils.py.

* Wire rebuildCatalog when a PloneGlossary is renamed or moved using
  events framework.

1.4.0 RC1

  explicitly selected

* Added a patch for ZCTextIndex _apply_index method: search terms with
  synonymous found in global glossaries are replaced by an equivalent

  is disabled by default (see config.py). [bmathieu]

* Fill portlet by template construct instead of javascript [bmathieu]

* Dropped plone 2.0 compatibility: use css and javascript
  registries. Portlet structure complies with plone 2.1/2.5 standard

##################

* Fixed a problem in htm2text. Carriage returns were not interpreted

  of "plone glossary".
