Question workflow
=================

  >>> from bungeni.models.domain import Question

Setup
-----

  >>> import bungeni.core.workflows.adapters
  >>> import bungeni.core.interfaces
  >>> import ore.workflow
  >>> import copy
  >>> import datetime
  
  
some setup for tests

   >>> from zope import component
   >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   >>> from ore.alchemist.interfaces import IDatabaseEngine
   >>> from ore.alchemist import Session
   >>> from bungeni import models as model
   >>> from bungeni.models import domain, schema


   
   
Setting up Database Connection and Utilities:

   >>> db = create_engine('postgres://localhost/bungeni-test', echo=False)
   >>> component.provideUtility( db, IDatabaseEngine, 'bungeni-db' )
   >>> model.metadata.bind = db   
   >>> model.metadata.create_all()
   >>> schema.QuestionSequence.create(db) 
   >>> from alchemist.security.schema import metadata  
   >>> metadata.bind = db
   >>> metadata.create_all()  
   >>> session = Session()




Get some standard dates for testing   
   >>> today = datetime.date.today()
   >>> yesterday = today - datetime.timedelta(1)
   >>> tomorrow = today + datetime.timedelta(1)
   >>> dayat = today + datetime.timedelta(2)


set up utilities
---------------  
  
  >>> today = datetime.date.today()
  
  
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.states.WorkflowState,
  ...    (bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.adapters.QuestionWorkflowAdapter,
  ...    (Question,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    ore.workflow.workflow.WorkflowInfo,
  ...    (Question,))

  >>> component.provideHandler(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.events.workflowTransitionEventDispatcher)

  >>> import bungeni.core.version
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.version.ContextVersioned,
  ...    (bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersionable,),
  ...    bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersioned)
  
Security Adapters

  >>> import alchemist.security.permission
  >>> import alchemist.security.role

  
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    alchemist.security.role.GlobalPrincipalRoleMap,
  ...    (bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    alchemist.security.permission.GlobalRolePermissionMap,
  ...    (bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    alchemist.security.role.LocalPrincipalRoleMap,
  ...    (bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    alchemist.security.permission.LocalRolePermissionMap,
  ...    (bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))


  >>> from zope.interface import classImplements
  >>> classImplements( bungeni.models.domain.Question, bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersionable)

In order to create a participation, we need a principal:

  >>> from bungeni.core.testing import create_principal, create_participation
  >>> import zope.security.management
  >>> zope.security.management.endInteraction()

  >>> bob = create_principal("bob", "Bob", ("bungeni.Clerk",))
  >>> zope.security.management.newInteraction(create_participation(bob))

setup parliament, gov and ministry
----------------------------------

  >>> parliament = model.Parliament( short_name=u"p_1", start_date=yesterday, election_date=yesterday)
  >>> session.save(parliament)
  >>> session.flush()
  
  >>> gov = model.Government(short_name=u"gov_1", start_date=yesterday)
  >>> gov.parliament_id = parliament.parliament_id
  >>> session.save(gov)
  >>> session.flush()  
  
  >>> ministry = model.Ministry(short_name=u"ministry", start_date=yesterday)
  >>> ministry.government_id = gov.government_id
  >>> session.save(ministry)
  >>> session.flush()




setup a sitting
Sittings
--------

any group can schedule a sitting, a sitting is treated as a physical
meeting of the group by the system. 

 >>> st = model.SittingType()
 >>> st.sitting_type = u"morning"
 >>> st.start_time = datetime.time(8,30)
 >>> st.end_time = datetime.time(12,30) 
 >>> session.save(st)
 >>> session.flush()

 >>> st.sitting_type_id
 1L
 
 >>> sit1 = model.GroupSitting()
 >>> sit1.start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
 >>> sit1.end_date = datetime.datetime.now()
 >>> sit1.sitting_type = st.sitting_type_id
 >>> session.save(sit1)
 >>> session.flush()   
 
 >>> sit2 = model.GroupSitting()
 >>> sit2.start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
 >>> sit2.end_date = datetime.datetime.now()
 >>> sit2.sitting_type = st.sitting_type_id
 >>> session.save(sit2)
 >>> session.flush()   
 
Transition events
-----------------

We set up event subscribers to make sure all registered transition
events are called.

  >>> from bungeni.core.workflows import testing
  >>> check_transition_events = testing.provide_transition_events_check(
  ...     bungeni.core.workflows.question.wf)
  
Workflow
--------

  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow, IWorkflowInfo

  >>> def transitions(question):
  ...     wf = IWorkflow(question)
  ...     info = IWorkflowInfo(question)
  ...     state = info.state().getState()
  ...     return tuple(transition.transition_id for transition in wf.getTransitions(state))


Permissions
-----------
  >>> def permission(question):
  ...   wf = IWorkflow(question)
  ...   info = IWorkflowInfo(question)
  ...   state = info.state().getState()
  ...   return tuple(transition.permission for transition in wf.getTransitions(state))

Schedule a question
-------------------
  >>> def schedule_question(question_id):
  ...   item_schedule = domain.ItemSchedule()
  ...   item_schedule.sitting_id = sit1.sitting_id
  ...   item_schedule.item_id = question.question_id
  ...   session.save(item_schedule)
  ...   session.flush()   


Add question to db
------------------

  >>> question = Question()
  >>> question.subject = u"subject of the question"
  >>> question.question_text = u"The question"
  >>> session.save(question)
  >>> session.flush()

set up a security mapping
#XXX permisssion as yet untested 

  >>> rpm = zope.securitypolicy.interfaces.IRolePermissionMap( question )
 
just a variable to count the versions:
  >>> i = 0
 
  
First we initialize the workflow.
  
  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'create',)

  >>> permission(question)
  (Global(CheckerPublic,zope.security.checker),)

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('create')

  >>> question.question_id == None
  False

  >>> question.parliament_id == None
  False


The question is now in a draft state.

  >>> transitions(question)
   (u'submit-to-clerk',)
    
  >>> permission(question)
  (u'bungeni.question.Submit',)



the question does not yet have a submitted date
   >>> question.submission_date 
   
When we submit the question, a new version is created.
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('submit-to-clerk')

The transition action returns None, indicating that the the current
instance is still active.

  >>> result is None
  True

and the date  was set to clerk_submission_date today
   >>> question.submission_date == today
   True

Verify that a new version was issued.

  >>> from bungeni.core.interfaces import IVersioned
  >>> versions = IVersioned(question)
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
  
Let's examine the version.

  >>> version = list(versions.values())[0]
  >>> version.status
  u'questionstates.draft'

Submitted:

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'withdraw-submitted', u'received-by-clerk')

A question can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> question_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-submitted')   

  >>> question_withdraw.status
  u'questionstates.withdrawn'  

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
  

Received:

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'require-edit-by-mp', u'complete', u'withdraw-received')

A question can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> question_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-received')   

  >>> question_withdraw.status
  u'questionstates.withdrawn'  
  
  

  
If it needs clarification this sets it back to draft and it must be submitted again  
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('require-edit-by-mp')
  

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'resubmit-clerk', u'withdraw-amend')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True

    
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')
  
versioned again
  
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
     
    
  >>> IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')
    
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True    
    
complete the question

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('complete')  
    
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
    
      
  
The speakers office now has to review the question

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

A question can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> question_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-complete')   

  >>> question_withdraw.status
  u'questionstates.withdrawn'


Reject the question

  >>> question_reject = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> transitions(question_reject)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_reject).fireTransition('reject') 

  >>> transitions(question_reject)
  ()     

If the questions requires amendment it is sent back to the owner
and has to be resubmitted 

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> question_amend = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_amend).fireTransition('require-amendment')   
  
it gets versioned before amendment
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True
    
  
  >>> transitions(question_amend)
  (u'complete-clarify', u'mp-clarify')

The clerks office can resubmit the question

  >>> question_clerk_resubmit = copy.deepcopy(question_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_clerk_resubmit).fireTransition('complete-clarify')    
  >>> transitions(question_clerk_resubmit)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True  


or the question can be send back to the mp for further clarification

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_amend).fireTransition('mp-clarify')  
  >>> transitions(question_amend)
  (u'resubmit-clerk', u'withdraw-amend')

  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True  



A question can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> question_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(question_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-amend')   

  >>> question_withdraw.status
  u'questionstates.withdrawn'


  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_amend).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')  

it gets versioned by resubmitting after amendment
  >>> i = i + 1
  >>> len(list(versions.values())) == i
  True

  >>> transitions(question_amend)   
  (u'withdraw-submitted', u'received-by-clerk')

clerks recieves it

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_amend).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')  


  
Appove the question and set the approval date and serial number

  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'withdraw-complete', u'approve', u'require-amendment', u'reject')

  >>> question.approval_date

  >>> question.question_number

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question).fireTransition('approve')  
  
  >>> question.approval_date  == today 
  True
  
  >>> question.question_number == None
  False
  
  
  >>> transitions(question)
  (u'defer', u'withdraw-admissible', u'send-ministry', u'schedule')
  

A question can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  
  
  >>> question_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(question)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-admissible')   

  >>> question_withdraw.status
  u'questionstates.withdrawn'


A written response to the question

  >>> question_written_response = copy.deepcopy(question)

  >>> question_written_response.ministry_submit_date

  >>> question_written_response.ministry_id = ministry.ministry_id


  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_written_response).fireTransition('send-ministry')  
  
  >>> question_written_response.ministry_submit_date == today  
  True
  
  >>> transitions(question_written_response)
   (u'elapse-pending', u'respond-writing', u'forward-ministry')
   
The question can be forwarded to another ministry.

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_written_response).fireTransition('forward-ministry')  
  
  >>> transitions(question_written_response)
   (u'elapse-pending', u'respond-writing', u'forward-ministry')  
   

A question can elapse if no answer is given

  >>> question_written_response_elapse = copy.deepcopy(question_written_response)


  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_written_response_elapse).fireTransition('elapse-pending')  
  
  >>> transitions(question_written_response_elapse)
   ()

Or the question can be responded to in writing

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(question_written_response).fireTransition('respond-writing')  
  
  >>> transitions(question_written_response)
  (u'answer',)  

defer the question
