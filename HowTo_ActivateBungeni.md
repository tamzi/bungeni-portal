## Automated Activation ##

Automated activation can be done via  selenium script. Note: this will only work on a freshly installed system where no parliament has been activated. Usually that is the state right after a reset-db and load-demo-data has been run on the Bungeni installation.

  1. Download and install Selenium IDE into your firefox installation from [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org)
  1. Checkout the latest version of the Activate Bungeni test case from subversion :
```
svn export http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/SeleniumTestSuites/
```
  1. The script we are interested in is called ActivateBungeni
  1. Now launch firefox - and make sure Bungeni has been started up. Make sure you are logged out of Bungeni. Go to the Bungeni login page. (directly on port 8081)
  1. Now go to tools -> Selenium IDE in firefox, and in the Selenium screen open the 'ActivateBungeni' test case.
  1. make sure that the base url for the selenium test case is set to the current bungeni installation home url.
  1. Set the speed of the test to "Slow", and click run test case.
  1. The test case will take about 5 - 8 minutes to run - at the end you will have an activated Bungeni installation
  1. The test case also activates all the ministries and committees for the parliament.
