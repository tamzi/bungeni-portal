Motion workflow
=================

  >>> from bungeni.core.domain import Motion
  >>> import bungeni.core as model
  >>> import datetime
  
  some setup for tests

   >>> from zope import component
   >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   >>> from ore.alchemist.interfaces import IDatabaseEngine
   >>> from ore.alchemist import Session
   >>> from bungeni import core as model
   >>> from bungeni.core import domain, schema
   
Setting up Database Connection and Utilities:

   >>> db = create_engine('postgres://localhost/bungeni-test', echo=False)
   >>> component.provideUtility( db, IDatabaseEngine, 'bungeni-db' )
   >>> model.metadata.bind = db   
   >>> model.metadata.create_all()
   >>> schema.QuestionSequence.create(db) 
   >>> from alchemist.security.schema import metadata  
   >>> metadata.bind = db
   >>> metadata.create_all()  
   >>> session = Session()


Setup
-----

  >>> import bungeni.core.workflows.motion
  >>> import bungeni.core.interfaces
  >>> import ore.workflow
  >>> import copy
  
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.WorkflowState,
  ...    (bungeni.core.interfaces.IBungeniContent,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.motion.MotionWorkflowAdapter,
  ...    (Motion,))

  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    ore.workflow.workflow.WorkflowInfo,
  ...    (Motion,))

  >>> component.provideHandler(
  ...    bungeni.core.workflows.motion.workflowTransitionEventDispatcher)

  >>> import bungeni.core.version
  >>> component.provideAdapter(
  ...    bungeni.core.version.ContextVersioned,
  ...    (bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersionable,),
  ...    bungeni.core.interfaces.IVersioned)
  
Transition events
-----------------

We set up event subscribers to make sure all registered transition
events are called.

  >>> map = bungeni.core.workflows.motion.workflow_transition_event_map
  >>> check_transition_events = dict((states, False) for states in map.keys())

  >>> for states, iface in map.items():
  ...     def generate(key):
  ...         def handler(event):
  ...             check_transition_events[key] = True
  ...         return handler
  ...     component.provideHandler(generate(states), adapts=(iface,))
  
Workflow
--------

  >>> from ore.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow, IWorkflowInfo

  >>> def transitions(motion):
  ...     wf = IWorkflow(motion)
  ...     info = IWorkflowInfo(motion)
  ...     state = info.state().getState()
  ...     return tuple(transition.transition_id for transition in wf.getTransitions(state))


Permissions
-----------
  >>> def permission(motion):
  ...   wf = IWorkflow(motion)
  ...   info = IWorkflowInfo(motion)
  ...   state = info.state().getState()
  ...   return tuple(transition.permission for transition in wf.getTransitions(state))

Schedule a motion
-------------------
  >>> def schedule_motion(motion_id):
  ...   item_schedule = domain.ItemSchedule()
  ...   item_schedule.sitting_id = sit1.sitting_id
  ...   item_schedule.item_id = motion.motion_id
  ...   session.save(item_schedule)
  ...   session.flush()   

Sitting to schedule the motion:
-----------------------------
  >>> st = model.SittingType()
  >>> st.sitting_type = u"morning"
  >>> session.save(st)
  >>> session.flush()

  >>> st.sitting_type_id
  1L
 
  >>> sit1 = model.GroupSitting()
  >>> sit1.start_date = datetime.datetime.now()
  >>> sit1.end_date = datetime.datetime.now()
  >>> sit1.sitting_type = st.sitting_type_id
  >>> session.save(sit1)
  >>> session.flush() 

  >>> motion = Motion()
  >>> session.save(motion)
  >>> session.flush()

First we initialize the workflow.
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('create',)

  >>> permission(motion)
  (Global(CheckerPublic,zope.security.checker),)

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('create')

The motion is now in a draft state.


  >>> transitions(motion)
   ('make-private', 'submit-to-clerk')
    
  >>> permission(motion)
  ('bungeni.motion.Submit', 'bungeni.motion.Submit')

The Question can be made a private draft

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('make-private')
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('re-draft',)  

and can be put into draft state at a later time

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('re-draft')
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
   ('make-private', 'submit-to-clerk')


When we submit the motion, a new version is created.
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('submit-to-clerk')

The transition action returns None, indicating that the the current
instance is still active.

  >>> result is None
  True

Verify that a new version was issued.

  >>> from bungeni.core.interfaces import IVersioned
  >>> versions = IVersioned(motion)
  >>> len(list(versions.values()))
  1

Let's examine the version.

  >>> version = list(versions.values())[0]
  >>> version.status
  u'draft motion'

Submitted:

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('withdraw-submitted', 'received-by-clerk')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-submitted')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'  

  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')


Received:

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('require-edit-by-mp', 'complete', 'withdraw-received')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-received')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'  
  
  

  
If it needs clarification this sets it back to draft and it must be submitted again  
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('require-edit-by-mp')
  

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('resubmit-clerk', 'withdraw-amend')

    
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')
  
versioned again
  
  >>> len(list(versions.values()))
  2    
    
  >>> IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')
    
complete the motion

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('complete')  
    
  
The speakers office now has to review the motion

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('withdraw-complete', 'approve', 'require-amendment', 'reject')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-complete')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'


Reject the motion

  >>> motion_reject = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> transitions(motion_reject)
  ('withdraw-complete', 'approve', 'require-amendment', 'reject')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_reject).fireTransition('reject') 

  >>> transitions(motion_reject)
  ()     

If the motions requires amendment it is sent back to the owner
and has to be resubmitted 

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('withdraw-complete', 'approve', 'require-amendment', 'reject')

  >>> motion_amend = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('require-amendment')   
  
it gets versioned before amendment
  >>> len(list(versions.values()))
  3  
  
  >>> transitions(motion_amend)
  ('complete-clarify', 'mp-clarify')

The clerks office can resubmit the motion

  >>> motion_clerk_resubmit = copy.deepcopy(motion_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_clerk_resubmit).fireTransition('complete-clarify')    
  >>> transitions(motion_clerk_resubmit)
  ('withdraw-complete', 'approve', 'require-amendment', 'reject')


or the motion can be send back to the mp for further clarification

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('mp-clarify')  
  >>> transitions(motion_amend)
  ('resubmit-clerk', 'withdraw-amend')





A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion_amend)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-amend')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'


  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('resubmit-clerk')  

it gets versioned by resubmitting after amendment
  >>> len(list(versions.values()))
  4

  >>> transitions(motion_amend)   
  ('withdraw-submitted', 'received-by-clerk')

clerks recieves it

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_amend).fireTransition('received-by-clerk')  


  
Appove the motion

  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('withdraw-complete', 'approve', 'require-amendment', 'reject')

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('approve')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('defer', 'withdraw-admissible', 'schedule')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-admissible')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'


defer the motion

  >>> motion_defer = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_defer).fireTransition('defer')   
  
  >>> transitions(motion_defer)     
  ('schedule-deferred', 'elapse-defered',  'withdraw-deferred')
  
  
  
A motion can elapse if no answer is given
  >>> motion_elapse_defered = copy.deepcopy(motion_defer)
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_elapse_defered).fireTransition('elapse-defered')    
  >>> transitions(motion_elapse_defered)
  ()

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion_defer)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-deferred')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'  

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_defer).fireTransition('schedule-deferred')   
  >>> transitions(motion_defer)     
  ('postpone', 'debate', 'withdraw-scheduled')

schedule the motion
  >>> schedule_motion(motion.motion_id)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('schedule')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('postpone', 'debate', 'withdraw-scheduled')

A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-scheduled')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'

postpone the motion
  
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('postpone')  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('schedule-postponed', 'elapse-postponed', 'withdraw-postponed')
 
A motion can elapse without an answer 

  >>> motion_elapse_postponed = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_elapse_postponed).fireTransition('elapse-postponed')   
  >>> transitions(motion_elapse_postponed)
  ()
  
A motion can be withdrawn at (almost) any stage  
  
  >>> motion_withdraw = copy.deepcopy(motion)
  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion_withdraw).fireTransition('withdraw-postponed')   

  >>> motion_withdraw.status
   u'Motion withdrawn'

and reschedule it

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('schedule-postponed')  
  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ('postpone', 'debate', 'withdraw-scheduled')



The motion was debated

  >>> result = IWorkflowInfo(motion).fireTransition('debate')  
  >>> transitions(motion)
  ()
