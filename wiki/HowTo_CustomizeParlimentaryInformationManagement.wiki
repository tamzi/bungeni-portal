Bungeni language configuration is managed in this file:
{{{
{BUNGENI_INSTALL_PATH}/src/bungeni_custom/__init__.py. 
}}}
The location of this file may be different if you have a custom configuration location. (See [HowTo_CustomizeParlimentaryInformationManagement#Using_the_customization_folder Using the customization folder])

The parameters in the snippet below will be found in this file and determine how languages are handled in Bungeni and are discussed below.

{{{
# language ids, either as a space-separated string or as a list of strings
zope_i18n_allowed_languages = "ar en es es-do fr it nl pt ru sw tk" 

# boolean: True, False
zope_i18n_compile_mo_files = True 

# string, language identifier, must be one of zope_i18n_allowed_languages
default_language = "en"

# language ids for languages written right to left, as a space-separated string
right_to_left_languages = "ar" 
}}}

=== Setting the default language for the system ===
The system's default language can be set via the parameter *default_language* which is one of the language codes in the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.
This language will be used in the Bungeni user interface if the user has not chosen another language from the language menu or the browser language is not one of *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.

=== Enabling other languages ===
To enable or disable languages, add or remove language codes from the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*. 

Only enabled languages will show up in Bungeni's languages menu. With the settings above, this will be the the language menu:

http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/languages-menu.png

=== Other language settings ===
The parameter *zope_i18n_compile_mo_files* determines if message catalogs are compiled to a binary format.

To specify the languages for which the user interface should be rendered right-to-left, add or remove languages from *right_to_left_languages*.

== Workspaces ==
Every user who logs on to Bungeni has a workspace, where they may view, add and edit documents. The workspace in Bungeni is very similar to the interface provided by email applications such as Gmail or Yahoo mail.


The workspace has 3 main sections
  # my documents - Here a user finds all the documents that he has created, edited or signed in the lifetime of the current parliament
  # documents under consideration - This section contains all the documents currently going through the parliamentary document workflow that are viewable by other users ie. they are in states tagged "public" in the workflow configuration and are not tagged as being in terminal state.
  # scheduling - The schedule of sittings of the plenary and committees is found here. See section on scheduling


=== my documents section ===

The "my documents" section has four tabs

  * draft - This tab contains all the documents that the user is currently working on that have not been submitted to anyone else
  * inbox - This tab contains all the documents that require attention from the user, eg. a bill that requires clarification from an MP
  * sent - This tab contains documents that the user has worked on and submitted
  * archive - Documents this user submitted that have reached their terminal state in the current parliament are found in this tab


=== How to configure workspaces === 

Every document type has a workspace configuration file in the workspace folder of the bungeni_custom folder.

The administrator needs to specify which workspace tabs a document in a certain state will appear in for the different users.

For example

{{{
<state id="clarification_required">
  <tab id="inbox" roles="bungeni.Owner"/>
  <tab id="sent" roles="bungeni.Clerk"/>
</state>
}}}

The above snippet specifies that a document in the state, "clarification_required" will appear in the inbox of the person who introduced it(bungeni.Owner) and in the sent folder of the clerk(bungeni.clerk)

== Layout, theme and formats == 
The layout, look and feel of the portal is controlled by a theme template in conjunction with a set of css styles and rule files. A default theme is enabled for each Bungeni installation.

=== Enabling a country theme ===

Sample country themes exist at this location: http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/portal.country_themes/trunk

To enable a country theme, edit the country_theme parameter in the Fabric 'setup.ini' file. The default setting is as follows:

{{{
[custom]
...
country_theme = default
}}}

Set this parameter to the appropriate value (_It is recommended to use the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes_) e.g. for the Kenya theme the setting would be as follows:

{{{
[custom]
...
country_theme = ke
}}}

then run the following command in fabric


{{{
fab -H localhost enable_country_theme config_ini:portal 
}}}

=== Changing page layout ===   
=== Changing the Menu Order and Structure ===   

=== Styling with CSS  ===  

folder structure:

{{{
|-- css
|-- images
|-- js
`-- themes
    |-- layout.html
    `-- rules.xml
}}}

The CSS files for styling Bungeni are broken down into two files.

_reset.css_ and _skin.css_

  * reset.css - Has styling properties that affect width, height and alignment of Bungeni.

  * skin.css - Cosmetic changes such as text-color, background-color, border, typography are done here. 

styling in both CSS files is split into four major sections:

  * GENERAL - Applies site-wide
  * TEMPLATE-PORTAL - Anonymous user-space or public view
  * TEMPLATE-WORKSPACE - Logged in area
  * TEMPLATE-PORTAL-EXIST - Public view from an XML repository

Denoted at the start by a comment banner. e.g. for TEMPLATE-PORTAL

{{{
/* =============================================================================
   TEMPLATE PORTAL - Styling applied on portal
   ========================================================================== */
}}}

These are top-level class selector's found on the HTML `body` tag e.g. `<body class="template-portal">`

To increase width of the portal from the default `960px`.

_reset.css_ -> find `template-portal` top-level section and look under width sub-section

Similar process for change background-color albeit under the _skin.css_ file

=== Theming Bungeni using Skins ===  

Bungeni skins are located under the custom folder:

{{{
{BUNGENI_INSTALL_PATH}/src/bungeni_custom/ 
}}}
