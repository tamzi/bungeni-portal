# Introduction #

Bungeni provides various ways to configure, customize and manage the application. Presently there are user interfaces for some aspects, and none for others. The objective of this description is to identify the different points of configuration, management and customization of the system.

# Configuration, Customization and Management external to Bungeni sub-system #

All the below options are accessible external to the Bungeni application and its constraints. These changes require access to the file system, and to the source of the system. It is not advisable to make these changes on a live system - but instead on a test system, since it is possible some changes could adversely affect the system (i.e. bring it down )


## System Level Management ##

The bungeni installation is updated and built using a system called Fabric.

Fabric is a set of python libraries which allow automation and scripting of repeated activities like :

  * Restart the system
  * Updating the system
  * Reverting changes
  * Building the system from source
  * Resetting the database
  * Taking backups
  * Restoring backups
  * etc...

### Configuration files ###
