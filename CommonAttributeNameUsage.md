# Introduction #

The aim of this document is to describe common attribute names in groups and parliamentary items. Presently in the default setup of the system - there is a lot of confusion and misuse of attributes. This document will propose a standardized naming scheme across both types and describe the use of the attributes.

This is applicable to both the current system (where individual parliamentary item types and groups share only a limited set of the model ) and the future in terms of declarative Bungeni. The motivation to fixing it in the current is to make migration to the declarative system easier.

                hide("listing"),
            ],
            property=schema.TextLine(title=_("Acronym")),

# Common Attribute Names #

Groups and Parliamentary Items will have a different model - however there needs to be a standardized naming convention use for attribute names.

The following is a preliminary list of common standardized attribute names for both types - the name specified in the first column should be the name used both in groups and parliamentary items.

|common attribute|current use in PI| current use in GRP| description |
|:---------------|:----------------|:------------------|:------------|
|short\_title    |short\_name RENAME| short\_name RENAME| a short title |
|long\_title     |full\_name RENAME| full\_name RENAME | a long title |
|acronym         |NOT PRESENT      |NOT PRESENT(misused as short\_name) | an acronym for the item or group |
|item\_number    |bill\_number, motion\_number etc RENAME | NOT PRESENT (parliament identifier misued as short\_name) | a human entered identifier for the group / human or automaticlally generated number for parliamentary item  |
|sort\_order     | NOT PRESENT / NOT REQUIRED | NOT PRESENT / TO BE ADDED | to specify a custom sort order in a listing |
|description     | description     | description       | Description of group/item |
|type            |type             |type               | type of group, parliamentary item (parliament, committee or motion, question ) |
