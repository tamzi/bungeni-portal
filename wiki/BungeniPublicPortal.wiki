= Levels of Content =

_(jean)_ :
There will likely be three levels of content in the site: public
content (such as background documents), content for members (such as
committee working documents, that aren't destined for publication), and
content in progress (such as news items and reports that have been
submitted for publication, but not yet edited and approved by the site
editor(s)). 

_(ashok)_ :
We need a physical separation between the "public" plone and the "internal" plone - the one which provides content for members and contains the work-in-progress applications....i do remember you mentioning using RSS feeds - and XML (using Entransit) to feed a public website..... since for a real deployment we wouldnt want to put both the internal and external faces of the website on the same plone installation or server.

_(jean)_ :
I believe we can treat these as separate issues:
  # Build a Plone with appropriate access rights for the various groups
   that will use it.
  # Deploy a subset to a second Plone later on.

(2) doesn't have to impact (1), and it's worthwhile doing the access
rights properly from the start.
