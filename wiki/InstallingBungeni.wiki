#summary How to install a development instance of Bungeni
#labels Featured

==Pre-requisites==

  * Build environment (on ubunutu do a `sudo apt-get install build-essentials` )
  * user Python 2.5 (or 2.4) built from source. (on ubuntu /debian you will need to install development libaries/headers for imaging (libjpeg62-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libpng12-dev)  and bz2 (libbz2-dev) libraries). 
    * For comipling the xapian bindings you will have to switch the user python to the primary python on the system either by aliasing it (alias='/my/path/to/myuser/python') or by changing the python referenced by /usr/bin/python (on debian /ubuntu you can switch between system pythons by using the update-alternatives command).
  * PostGreSQL build from source requires development libraries/headers for: bison, flex ,readline (libreadline5-dev), zlib (zlib1g-dev). (on ubuntu installed via apt-get)
  * SVN build from source requires dev - libraries and installs of the following :
    * libaprutl1-dev
    * libneon26-dev
    * swig

==Setup==

Note: 
the python setuptools package (a python egg) is used by buildout, if you have an older version of setuptools, you might need to update it manually first (from http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/setuptools/) in the python used for zope. 
Update instructions at: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions

If you dont have setuptools installed, buildout downloads and installs it automatically.

In order to install it, use buildout. These steps should be all you need to setup a Zope instance with all the required products and libraries:

{{{
$ svn co https://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/bungeni.buildout/trunk/ --username <username>
bungeni
$ cd bungeni
$ python bootstrap.py # not the system python! The one you use with Zope, i.e. 2.4.x. 
$ ./bin/buildout  # wait a while..
$ ./bin/setup-database # this will setup the postgres db
$ ./bin/paster serve debug.ini # this will launch the server in debug mode...
}}}

On a Mac, you may need to increase shmmax value to get postgresql up and running.

The buildout includes !DeadlockDebugger, so if you start Zope in debug mode, it will stop at a debugger prompt if an exception is raised.
