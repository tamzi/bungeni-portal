The legislative activity of Parliaments is one of its fundamental
activities. Keeping track of the parliamentary activities related to the
life of a bill is a very strategic feature.

Bills have/should have an history that lists the dates and
legislative actions affecting the proposal from its introduction to
final disposition/approval or rejection. This history should be
associated with the debates, votes, and documents that accompany the
bill in its parliamentary process.


Some parliament have also introduced a "notification service"
that allows citizens to track legislative activities on proposals,
committees, authors and subjects by receiving notification emails so
that citizens can follow their progress through the legislative
process.

Below you find a list of data that are used to "track" bill
process. Most if not all (apart the bill actual text and its
versions) are very short data and most of the time in form of
standardised parameter or sourced out of other data table.

The best example that I could find, needless to say, does not come
from a parliament but from a very smart NGO in USA.

See this bill for instance ... it makes things very clear:
