<li>notes with concern the unacceptable behaviour of Mr Sammy Goedemann, a DA councillor in the Breede Valley Municipality, who swore at Sarah Beukes, an HIV positive person and a victim of farm evictions in the Rawsonville area in the Western Cape, and told her to “voertsek” when she attempted to ask a question during a community meeting;</li>
<li>further notes that this is a clear indication of the DA’s intolerant attitude towards the sick, poor and destitute people of this country;</li>
<li>recognises that this attitude is inconsistent with their public policy statements on HIV/Aids, where they portray themselves as advocates for HIV/Aids sufferers and the destitute of this country; and</li>
<li>calls on the DA to do the right thing and apologise for such unacceptable behaviour and to remove Mr Goedemann whom is clearly not suitable to be a public representative. </li>

He must be on his way.<br><br><strong>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATIONS ABROAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 30 OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE</strong><br><br>2.53<br>THE CHAIRMAN, STANDING COMMITTEE ON BUDGET (Mr William Okecho): Mr Speaker, the report I am about to present has been circulated and it has also been posted in the Members’ e-mail addresses. I, therefore, would wish to just introduce the report here for purposes of getting the Members aware of the content of the report.<br><br>In compliance with Rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure, which obliges a parliamentary delegation upon return to report to the House its experiences and findings, I beg to present the report of the delegation that attended a training workshop on the financial oversight functions of parliamentarians that was held in Accra-Ghana in December 2006.<br><br>Mr Speaker, you authorised a delegation of five people, comprising of – <br><br>1.Hon. William Okecho<br>2.Hon. Samuel Byanagwa<br>3.Hon. Kiiza Rwebembera<br>4.Hon. Christine Bako and<br>5.Robert Tumukwasibwe, all from the Budget Committee to join their colleagues from the sister parliaments of Tanzania and Malawi –(Interruption) <br><br>THE SPEAKER: Maybe just bear with me to introduce hon. Matia Isoke, who has joined us. He was a minister.<br><br>MR OKECHO: The team joined the parliamentarians of Tanzania and Malawi at a training workshop on the budget. The workshop was held in Accra-Ghana, and it was organised by the Parliamentary Centre of Canada and facilitated by the staff of the Poverty Reduction Office in Accra. <br><br>The six-day workshop took place from 11 – 15 December 2006. The theme of the workshop was, Financial Oversight Functions of Parliamentarians: tools and mechanism for optimum government budget analysis.<br><br>The workshop was extremely exciting as we learnt a lot about the tools that legislators should use to analyse budget documents, questions that they should ask of the Executive, budget documents that they should consult and information they should seek in order to make the budget a meaningful political, economic, social and legal tool in the delivery of public goods and services.<br><br>We examined five principles of good budgeting namely; comprehensiveness, predictability, contestability, transparency and periodicity. We further examined the role of parliament in the budget process at the budget formulation stage, debate or approval stage and monitoring and audit stages. <br><br>We looked at how legislators can ensure budget compliance by emphasising three key issues during the entire budget process namely; accountability, openness, and participation. We also looked at tools that legislators can use to analyse whether the budget is pro-poor and is in tandem with the poverty reduction strategy paper, and also whether the budget supports the millennium development goals and targets and also whether it enhances gender equity.<br><br>Mr Speaker, I should also report that I led the Uganda delegation to the training workshop and I was unanimously elected to the steering committee of the African Poverty Reduction Network to represent the East African legislatures. (Applause)&nbsp; <br><br>I am now performing that function under AWEPA, which cooperates with the parliamentary centre and is now using my services to train other parliamentarians in the parliamentary budget processes and I have already been to Somali land on that mission. I shall continue with other 25 countries to perform this very honourable task.<br><br>The detailed report shedding more light on the tools for budgetary analysis is hereby laid at Table and we have also, as I said, sent copies to Members’ e-mails. Copies have also been made and are available outside on the tables. We encourage all Members to read the report and use the contained analytical tools to make the intervention of Parliament and its committees in the budget process vibrant. <br><br>As you are aware, the budget process is now on. We have held the first national budget conference, which was held on the 11-12 January this year and I have requested Members to take special interest in the budgeting processes in their districts and I am told that many of them are attending. <br><br>I wish to end by thanking you, Mr Speaker, very much for giving me the opportunity and also the Members for having taken so seriously the task of going to represent Uganda in this function.<br><br>THE SPEAKER: I want to thank you and the delegation for the presentation and for this report. I want to appeal to other delegations in future to invoke the provisions of Rule 30 so that others who are not in the delegation can benefit from the experience.<br><br>MR DOMBO: I just want to seek clarification from the honourable member who has been presenting the report. He said that he has sent some information to our e-mails. What I want to seek clarification on is whether our budget here as the Parliament of Uganda, the one we approved, complies with the five principles he has stated and the other two pillars of pro-poor and supportive to the millennium development goals? If not, what can we do to measure up to what you have been studying in Accra? Thank you very much.<br><br>MR OKECHO: Mr Speaker, we examined budgets of very many countries while we were in Accra. We also took there our own budget speech and we realised that there is a great deal to be done to make sure our budgets are pro-poor. <br><br>Our Members have been asked to examine the next budget to ensure that all the principles we learnt are complied with. That is why we started by requesting the Members to go right a way to the districts and so on, to make sure that most of the issues being discussed there are understood, so that when they come, we have to relate whatever is being brought in the budget to the various qualities and issues that we think must be contained in the budget. <br><br>But there have been so many loopholes and so many missing gaps in many of our budget speeches. We think that since we have started quite early, next time we will make sure that we comply with the provisions required.<br><br>THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, you must be aware and I believe each one of you has a copy of the Budget Act. The purpose of enacting a Budget Act was to give you more effective participation in the budget process so that you do not only listen to the budget being read on 15th June, but you must have participated in its formulation. <br><br>As you know, beginning 1st April, His Excellency the President will send to Parliament indicating matters related to the budget and you will have a month to look at the proposed budget so that you can have an input. When this exercise begins in April, take into account what has been contained in the report that has been given to us. This will enable you to effectively participate and suggest ways of improving the budget. Thank you.&nbsp; <br><br>",,draft,,t,tableddocument
4093,9,417,en,Lake Victoria drying up,,"Wednesday, 04 January 2006<br><br>Parliament met at 2.40 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.<br><br><strong>PRAYERS</strong><br><br>(The Deputy Speaker, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, in Chair.)<br><br>The House was called to order.<br><br><strong>COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR</strong><br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I would like to thank you very much for being so diligent and coming back to handle business, which is pending, and I want to welcome you back from the Christmas and the New Year’s recess. I hope you have had time to irrigate your constituents on important issues. I wish you fruitful deliberations.&nbsp; <br><br>2.42<br>MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA (Buvuma County, Mukono): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to raise an issue of public importance and it is regarding the declining waters of Lake Victoria. When you travel along the shores of Lake Victoria, especially in the islands of Buvuma, you realize that the lake is actually drying up. <br><br>To make matters worse, during this Seventh Parliament the Minister of Works, Housing and Communications constructed the piers at Kiyindi main land and at Kilongo, Buvuma to enable the ferry to move properly. But as we talk, the ferry cannot access the piers. It stops in the middle of the water and we have to put timber across. Now the ferry cannot transport vehicles. I am just urging government to have interest –(Interruption)- the minister from Kalangala is just joking; I hope the voters can realize that. (Laughter)<br><br>Madam Speaker, my colleague knows that even the shift they are constructing - I heard him saying that the piers also have risen up and even the ship cannot access it. I am just urging government to take up a study such that they can tell us the cause because from the experience, people are actually assuming that maybe it is the second outlet at the Kiira Dam, which has caused this. The Government should come up and tell the whole country the cause. It is not only the ferry but even the boats cannot land as they used to; they stop at 100 meters from the shore and people have to pay -(Interruption)<br><br>2.44<br>THE MINISTER OF STATE, WATER (Mrs Mary Mutagamba): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I want to thank the honourable member for bringing up the issue of water levels, especially in Lake Victoria and the drought. I want to assure this House that tomorrow - I have just been conducting a meeting and we have agreed with all stakeholders that we address the nation at a press briefing. So, tomorrow we will make a press briefing and thereafter we shall circulate the information. I would not like to talk about it now because we are still working on it but it is coming out tomorrow at 11 O’clock.<br><br>MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for the assurance, but it is not only the ministry -(Interruption)<br><br>MR MWANDHA: It is normal practice that if there is a major issue, the statement is first made in Parliament. Why does the honourable minister want us to wait until the press statement is made tomorrow when in fact we can have the information today? This in my view is not correct procedure.<br><br>DR EPETAIT: Thank you, Madam Speaker and I thank my colleague for giving way. The issue of the declining water levels in Lake Victoria is not just a Ugandan problem, but it is a regional problem. We moved – the Committee on Agriculture moved to Kenya and Tanzania late last year when we were monitoring the performance of Lake Victoria Environment Programme, and we noted with concern the same problems that my colleague has just brought up of piers, which are hanging, and the ships in the countries of Kenya and Tanzania. The boat cannot dock on the piers, which have been constructed at such exorbitant costs. <br><br>There is growing concern even in those countries to what could be remedied, but I have to bring it to your attention that even the problem or the challenge of a second outlet could become a factor. Therefore, I would ask the minister that in issuing her statement to this House, she should take into consideration the feeling, or we should network with the colleagues because this is really a regional problem; it is not localized to Uganda. We would not appear to be moving alone when the same problem is affecting other countries and the statement may not augur well with the others. So, honourable minister, take it that it is a serious international problem and your statement would go a long way in supporting our regional integration. Thank you.<br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, at which stage do you intend to brief this House about that problem?<br><br>MRS MUTAGAMBA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Of course looking at the tight programme that Parliament had, I did not know whether we could fix in today and if you still have another sitting, I could bring it in here. Otherwise we have been requested to make a statement to the media to cover national, regional and international concerns. <br><br>Of course at least this House knows I am the Minister or the President of the African Ministers responsible for Water in Africa and as such, I cover that regional aspect of it. On top of that, you should also remember that Uganda is hosting the Nile Basin Secretariat and we are now in the process of negotiating how to share and utilize the water resources of the Nile which originate from Lake Victoria. It is an international issue and that is why I thought we should address it at the international level. But if it is a wish of this House, we could have a session and we discuss it.&nbsp; <br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think, honourable minister, that before you pass your briefing in the media, it would be appropriate for you to brief the House. So, we shall make room for it.<br><br>MRS MUTAGAMBA: Okay, thank you. <br><br>MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I wind up, since the minister has promised to make a statement, I want to urge the Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications, as a short-term measure, to redesign the piers. Otherwise, the statement will not do much really. What we need, let the Ministry of Works pick interest in this matter, they redesign the pier such that the ferry can dock. Otherwise, if they do not address that problem as we talk, Buvuma will be cut off. I thank you.<br><br>2.48<br>MR ODONGA OTTO (Aruu County, Pader): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to raise two issues of national concern. <br><br>Firstly, a couple of days ago, on the 31st of December last year, one prominent Pastor Kayanja, in his 31st December summon, prophesized two issues. One, he was showing knowledge of the election results; that the winner will get 61.8 percent and of course as a mobiliser in FDC, I have special interest in that percentage. But most alarmingly he said that one of the presidential aspirants would die. Madam Speaker, with all due respect to the Minister of Ethics and Integrity, who also happens to be a saved person, he prophesized that one of the six presidential aspirants, now five, will die. <br><br>I am well aware that we have President Museveni standing; we have retired Col. Kizza Besigye; we have Bwanika; we have Sebaana Kizito and we have Maria Obote. I would want to find out from the Minister of Information and the Minister of Ethics, later on the Attorney-General, if you have made any efforts to draw a charge sheet on such pastors who have openly said one of the persons will die before the 23rd of February, because he may have to help Police to tell us when at which spot so that the Police can avert such a kind of catastrophe. <br><br>Madam Speaker, this is a very serious matter and people all over the country are saying, “Which one will die”? For us in FDC we do not want anyone to die; we do not want President Museveni to die because we just want to defeat him when he is still alive. So, can the Minister of Ethics and Integrity tell us if these are the kind of Churches we are having in Uganda, giving such dangerous statements?<br><br>PROF. KABWEGYERE: Madam Speaker, is the honorable member in order to popularize not only speculation, but probably madness by bringing it in this House as an issue for debate, when this Parliament has no capacity to control the phantasmal of the imagination of some people? Is he in order?<br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honorable members, hon. Otto says he heard the prophecy and wants to know whether the Government is taking an interest in that prophecy.&nbsp; I think that is what he is asking.<br><br>2.53<br>THE MINISTER OF STATE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY (Mr Tim Lwanga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. In this world where we live, we have got a “natural us” and a “spiritual us”, and I remember in the year 2004 in December that is when Pastor Robert Kayanja made his predictions about the five presidential candidates; he made the predictions with the fact that probably one of them would not make it through, and so many other predictions. So really what happened recently was a repeat of what he had said previously. What we have got to do is to pray that if the predictions are right, whoever my candidate is, they are not going to die. Otherwise, I do not think this is an issue –(Interruptions)<br><br>MR MWANDHA: Madam Speaker, the issue raised by hon. Odonga Otto is a very serious issue because of the status of Kayanja. I hear that sometime back he prophesized that we were going to have an earthquake and we had a small earthquake and, therefore, the matter is worrying a lot of Ugandans and is brought to this House. Is it in order for the hon. Tim Lwanga, the Minister responsible for Ethics and Integrity, to joke about it? Can he simply joke about a matter, which is concerning citizens of this country?&nbsp; <br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, honorable members, you can only ask the Government really to be concerned. I do not know how any of us can control what Pastor Kayanja says, what he predicts, and what he prophesizes. It is very hard.<br><br>THE MINISTER OF STATE, INFORMATION (Dr Nsaba Buturo): Madam Speaker, it is not true that matters of prophecy are the business of the Government of the day. I want to say to honorable members that those of us who are versed with the Bible, we have an option. If the prophet says something and you believe it is true, there is a very important option that I would want members who are concerned to take advantage of, and that is prayer. (Laughter)<br><br>Madam Speaker, I just want to assure honorable members that prayer does work and if anyone, hon. Otto included, is concerned about his candidate and every other candidate I should add, we should pray so that God does the opposite of what had been predicted.<br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay honorable members, let us pray for all the candidates.<br><br>MR ODONGA OTTO: Madam Speaker, thank you for the minister’s response and I hope it has not set a precedence where if hon. Otto opens up his church tomorrow and says the President will die and then you come to Parliament and say, we should pray. Because I see some criminal elements but I respect the minister’s response. Thank you very much.",,draft,,t,tableddocument

However, I note that the number is smaller than yesterday’s. I know there is a committee, which is busy in the Eastern part of Uganda, but others should be here. I do not know what is happening, even to the Front Bench. I do not know whether they have a meeting, but I have not been informed. Anyway, I welcome you.<br><br>I will be adjusting the Order Paper to allow a statement from hon. Baba Diri and an informal question from hon. Banyenzaki. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that there is something which we as Parliament should take note of and find a solution to. The problem is the road carnage. There are very many deaths on our roads. I think something should be done to curb this because there was an accident in Mabira and another one on Masaka road. I think something has to be done. There must be something wrong. I am not supposed to participate in the debate, but I also own a constituency and I am a citizen who takes advantage of my seat here to point out what is going on. Something should be done. <br><br>MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. One of the issues why the attendance is poor is that in most cases we begin plenary very late, yet you always adjourn this House to 2.00 p.m. Members are always here at 2.00 p.m. but we begin towards 3.00 p.m., so there is need to keep time.<br><br>THE SPEAKER: That has no merit, I must say. You mean they went away because we did not start at 2.00 p.m.? When I am in my chambers I watch the attendance here.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>PRESENTATION OF PAPERS</strong><br><br>2.42<br>THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE (Mrs Ssezi Mbaguta): Mr Speaker and honourable members, I would like to present the Public Service Commission Annual Report, 2005. In accordance with Article 166, sub-section 3 of the Constitution, the Public Service Commission is required to submit a report to Parliament in respect of each year on the performance of its function. I now, therefore, present the Public Service Commission Annual Report, 2005, to Parliament in line with the constitutional provision. The report represents the highlights of the performance of the Public Service Commission for the year under review, including key outputs, key events, challenges faced and way forward. I beg to present and lay it on the Table.&nbsp; <br><br>THE SPEAKER: Let the appropriate committee of Parliament handle it and then subsequently report to us.<br><br><strong>PERSONAL STATEMENT</strong><br><br>2.44<br>MRS MARGARET BABA DIRI (NRM, Woman Representative, Koboko): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to raise issues of great concern about the people of Koboko. The issues are the outbreak of Meningitis, and the water crisis in Koboko District. In mid January 2007 there was an outbreak of Meningitis in Lobule sub-county in Koboko District. Within a matter of days the Meningitis spread like bushfire throughout the district of Koboko and even the whole West Nile. I understand it even spread to Karamoja and Kotido. The records are now in the Health Centre IV show that there 349 persons infected with Meningitis cumulatively, and 19 have already died, leaving alone those who have died at their homes. I am sure the number is greater.<br><br>I thank the Minister of Health for responding quickly by sending drugs for treating Meningitis. However, the vaccination delayed to some extent. It is on 02 February 2007 that immunisation started and indeed people are being immunised. Unfortunately they are immunising people from the age of two to 30, leaving out the age bracket above 31. That means the elderly people can die at ease without being immunised. Mr Speaker, why is it on earth that elderly people should die when actually death could be prevented? <br><br>I would like to remind the Minister of Health that Koboko is now a district and it deserves a district hospital. If we had a hospital, more lives would have been saved because there would be more staff and money to be used. Therefore, people of Koboko urge the Ministry of Health and government at large to upgrade the health centre IV of Koboko into a government hospital.<br><br>Koboko actually serves many people including those from Sudan and Congo. If you went to the hospital’s OPD now, you would find that the number is very high. We really need that hospital as quickly as possible.<br><br>Mr Speaker, about the water crisis;&nbsp; Koboko lies on the northwest side of Uganda where during this time of the year there is a prolonged dry season from November to the end of February and sometimes even March. At this time, all the wells and streams are dry. There is no water, especially in the town and the suburbs of the town council. At the moment in Koboko, poor as they are, people buy a jerry can of 20 litres at Shs 1,000, which is too much for them!<br><br>On 18 January 2007, we met the Minister of Water and Environment and discussed the issue of this water crisis. She told us she is going to do something about the emergency, that is, by providing maybe some big tanks at some points within the town council so that water could be drawn from Koch River to Koboko town, where people could buy it cheaply at Shs 100 or Shs 200, which is reasonable.

To commend His Excellency President Y.K. Museveni for the declaration of the cease-fire, and do call upon Joseph Kony to respond by accepting the cease-fire which should be respected, extended and widened as necessary.<br><br>2. To call upon the Government and the Lord’s Resistance Army to use the cease-fire as a basis for peaceful resolution of the conflict and the realisation of permanent peace.<br><br>3. To appreciate and encourage Acholi religious leaders, cultural leaders and political leaders in the North for their tireless efforts for the peaceful resolution of the conflict and for the realisation of the permanent peace.&nbsp; Madam Speaker, I beg to move.<br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it seconded?<br><br>MR OULANYAH: Yes, seconded.<br><br>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It has been seconded.<br><br>MR OMARA ATUBO: Thank you. Madam Speaker, I would say one of the great things that occurred to me and to many people this week, and even a little bit of last week, and possibly if we go back to last year, it had to do with this attempt to resolve the northern conflict peacefully.&nbsp; <br><br>For many years, this conflict has persisted and the military option has been tried; it has contained this situation but it has not resolved it.&nbsp; It has not ended in the total defeat of the rebels neither in the realisation of permanent peace. That is why some people in this country, including some Members of Parliament and the Acholi Religious leaders, came out with this proposal of pursuing peaceful methods of resolving this conflict.<br><br>One of the peaceful approach required by both belligerent groups - the two sides who are fighting - is naming their negotiating team. I want to commend the Government for naming the negotiating team headed by the First Deputy Prime Minister, hon. Eriya Kategaya last year, and that headed by Joseph Kony (LRA) to reciprocate by also naming his team so that these two could sit and find a way of ending this conflict. Madam Speaker, Joseph Kony up to now has not named his other negotiating team and we have been waiting.<br><br>An attempt was made last year at a cease-fire. The Government, as you know, gave its conditions for the cease-fire, one of which for was for the Lord’s Resistance Army fighting group to gather in a specific place. This seemed not to have been accepted, because despite this condition, the fighting continued.<br><br>Last week, Joseph Kony and LRA came on their own to say that they were ready for a cease-fire. Unfortunately, this cease-fire seems to have been breached before it even breathed. A few days later, the President addressed us in Gulu during the Women’s Day. The major part of his speech was devoted to the conflict in the north. To me, it was a rather hard-hitting speech.&nbsp; <br><br>However, I was relieved that two days later after that hard-hitting speech, the President said he was ready for a limited cease-fire. I think this move must not escape the action of this Parliament in whatever form we shall resolve because we are the elected leaders; we are the highest political organ in the country; we speak for our people.&nbsp; <br><br>Some of us come from this area where people have suffered for too long, we cannot wait for the President to announce this limited cease-fire. I think what we say will add a lot to the feeling of the national attitude towards the quick resolution of this conflict.&nbsp; <br><br>Therefore, I have come out with this motion to urge Parliament to do three basic things. One of them, no doubt, is to commend the President for at long last to accept or to declare this cease-fire. I think it is a great thing.&nbsp; It is limited I know, but it is a step forward. <br><br>It took the President a long time even to accept that the conflict in the North could be resolved peacefully. In the 6th Parliament, there was a Committee which came out with this proposal for the peaceful resolution of the conflict but was rejected. It was hon. Mao and myself who wrote a minority report and in that minority report, we said two things. One, that the Government of Uganda must immediately normalise its relationship with Sudan. This is because we were convinced that as long as Kony had a foreign territory to which he could escape, he could hide and be supported and it was going to be difficult to destroy him in order for the country to realise permanent peace. <br><br>The second part of our minority report was for Government to give a chance to the peaceful resolution of this conflict, but both were rejected in 1997.&nbsp; <br><br>I am very happy that a few years later, hardly four, five years, the Uganda Government has now normalised its diplomatic relations with Sudan. This has led to very interesting developments in the sense that it has allowed a foreign country with its army to go into its territory to chase an enemy.&nbsp; This was a very rare thing to happen.&nbsp; <br><br>Secondly, Sudan has actively invited our mission - I was talking to the head of our peace negotiating team, hon. Eriya Kategaya. I think on Monday a large delegation of Ugandans is going to Sudan in order to get things moving with Sudan. I think this is great. So, what do we do now? I think this Parliament, as I said, cannot escape this latest development on the cease-fire, limited as it is.&nbsp; <br><br>The first thing is that I am calling upon this Parliament to commend the President for coming a long way, as he did, to accept limited cease-fire. And in the same breath, we are also calling upon Kony to accept this cease-fire.&nbsp; <br><br>I do realise that this cease-fire is limited, but that experiment of a limited cease-fire is a beginning, and I think the President must not stop there. If this limited cease-fire can bear fruit and bring some degree of calmness and peace to stop the killing of people, to stop the human suffering that is taking place, I think the President should be able to extend it to cover a larger area.&nbsp; Not only that, instead of being five days, if it has worked, I do not see why it cannot be extended for a few days or for a few weeks or a few months.&nbsp; <br><br>Madam Speaker, it will not be fair for me to end my remarks without paying glowing tribute to the Acholi Religious leaders, the cultural leaders and the political leaders, especially, in Acholi. Many times they have risked their lives; they have been insulted; they have been suspected; they have even been spied on. But because they know that they are pursuing a cause which is right; a cause for the human dignity, a cause for human survival; they have persisted; they have tumbled; they have stepped on stones; they have fallen on the way. <br><br>If you listened to the President’s remark on Saturday, a person who gives up quickly would say, “to hell with this effort of peaceful resolution of conflict. Let us leave the President to try the military option”. I understand the religious leaders went to the President on Sunday and said, “No way, you must also give peaceful resolution a chance.” I am happy the President met them and the following day, what do we hear? The President had agreed to a limited cease-fire. So, I want to commend these Religious Leaders, the Government should give them a chance, and we should appreciate what they are doing.<br><br>I would also like to thank the honourable Members of Parliament. You remember you parted with about Shs100, 000 from your pocket at this very difficult time when Uganda is facing a very high level of poverty, and I know this money is very valuable to you. You gave Shs30 million to the five districts of Lira, Kitgum, Gulu, Apac and Pader.&nbsp; <br><br>I am also happy to recognise the contribution made by the team that was appointed to purchase these items and delivered them to all the districts. I want to thank you for that. <br><br>Madam Speaker, with these remarks, I call upon my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution.&nbsp; It is a great step forward to assist your brothers in the North to realise permanent peace. I thank you all.",,draft,,t,tableddocument

I wish to notify our women colleagues that a workshop on Women Friendly Legislative Practices has been organised for you. The workshop will commence this Friday, February 27th and run to Sunday, February 29th at Jinja Nile Resort. Our Office of Parliamentary Professional Development will provide the logistics for the seminar. You are advised to look at your invitation cards in your pigeonholes. I would like to wish you a successful event.<br><br>Honourable members, our former colleague in the Sixth Parliament, hon. Wilson Otage who was representing Usuk County, died yesterday at Mulago Hospital. Tomorrow at 10.00 a.m. there will be a service at All Saints Cathedral before the body is taken to Katakwi for burial. Tonight the body will stay at his home in Entebbe. <br><br>Honourable members, you vividly remember that when we reconvened after the Christmas recess, on the 10th of this month, my communication covered very sad news of the massacre at Abia in Lira District. The following week was also a week of lamentation because we were dealing with death that had occurred in Mabira forest along Kampala-Jinja Road as a result of a traffic accident.&nbsp; <br><br>Once again today, I very much regret to inform you – and perhaps you have already been informed - of the black Saturday, the 21st of this month. It is a black Saturday because of the tragic massacre by Kony’s beastly army, which resulted in the death of over 200 people and maybe some more may be recovered later. It has caused us a lot of anguish and I know this is true for not only me but also all of you. And the entire country is weeping for our brothers and sisters who died. We may ask Kony, “Why are you doing this?” But we do not have to wait for an answer, whichever answer Kony may want to give us. We have to move very fast and together to ensure that this does not continue, and to ensure that this year we end this Kony’s programme, which is anti-people. <br><br>We must move together: the Executive, Parliament and other organs of Government, to ensure that this ends because it has caused untold suffering to innocent people, and I am sure they are looking to us to find a solution. But since the Minister of Defence is going to make a statement and I know it is going to cover this incident, we shall debate it subsequently. But it is proper to observe a minute’s silence for both our Wilson Otage and our brothers and sisters who have died.<br><br>(The Members stood and observed a minute of silence.)<br><br>2.48<br>THE PRIME MINISTER (Prof. Apolo Nsibambi): Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, I wish to state that this tragic incident is greatly regretted and we convey our condolences to the relatives of the bereaved and to the entire country! I have requested the Minister of Defence to make a statement, which should assist us to discuss this matter so that we may find lasting solutions to this persistent problem.<br><br>THE SPEAKER: Thank you.",,draft,,t,tableddocument

It is the responsibility of every member in this House in your capacity as leaders, individuals, parents and concerned members of the society. Therefore, there is a responsibility for all of us to come together to deal with the many challenges in our society such as the establishment of the culture of learning and teaching in our schools which needs parents to participate in the fight against crime, particularly domestic violence which happens in the homes; the fight against HIV and Aids; lifestyle changes; and many other challenges where parents can make a big difference.<br><br>On several occasions, in answering the second part of the question, leaders in our country, including myself, in different platforms have all called upon families to take responsibility. In the draft of the moral charter of values, the family and the community are identified as co-socialising units that inspire and create the moral and ethical values in society. In this regard, the draft of the charter addresses specific issues that are related to the family – issues that create the promotion of family values; the fighting against domestic violence; the cultivation of a family and a communal environment that promotes the culture of care, generosity, and exclusivity; using resources efficiently and equitably to the benefit of all family and community members; and lastly benefiting others as well as ourselves through personal growth and the acquisition of skills.<br><br>I need to emphasise that it is very critical that in our anti-poverty strategy as well as in our efforts to end poverty – not just to reduce it, we must make sure that within a family and within each household where there is poverty, there is a resolution not to pass poverty to the next generation. Government, in that regard, must support families in their endeavours to achieve this noble goal. Thank you.",,draft,,t,tableddocument
