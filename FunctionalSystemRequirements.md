## Rota ##

**Schedule denoting the time each reporter will report to the House
Chamber to cover a certain portion of the proceedings.**

In the context of Bungeni, we also need to know that:
  * the rota refers to a set of available reporters;
  * this set needs to be globally configurable (providing the defaults for new rota) as well as locally configurable (editing the set of reporters available for a particular rota);
  * it is initially autogenerated, but items on the rota should be editable (reordered, or reassigned to a different reporter);
  * once complete, it needs to be circulated to subscribers, who may be individuals or groups;
  * if necessary, it may need to be re-edited and re-sent (if e.g. a reporter became ill halfway through a sitting).

### Take ###

**Segment of the sitting time allocated to a reporter to record the proceedings in the house**


An elaboration: it's the segment of the audio recording for the
allocated time. The reporter needs to transcribe this segment.

Current thinking is that the segments will be autogenerated from the
audio recording of the sitting, with an overlap of say 30s before and
after the allocated time. Flavio has also mentioned that in some
parliaments takes are speech-based, rather than time-based. I guess
this would have implications for rota generation
